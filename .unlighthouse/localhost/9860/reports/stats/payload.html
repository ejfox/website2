The `photo-container` now uses the `snap-start` and `snap-always` classes to enable snapping to each photo. Additionally, the `h-screen` and `overflow-y-auto` classes are added to ensure the page height adjusts dynamically based on the content and allows scrolling when necessary.

recursive scan, --depth option, and integrated TUI with some detailed info added\n\nProblem\n-------\nThe original tool only scanned the first directory level for my system, which hides nested repos for me.\n\nChanges\n-------\n* Improve recursive scanning of subdirectories, with a `--depth \u003Cn>` option to limit how deep to go.\n* Add a `-t/--tui` mode that launches an interactive blessed-contrib table:\n  – Displays symbol, repository name, and status in three columns.\n  – Use arrow keys to navigate; press space or enter to toggle a detail box showing branch and last commit info.\n  – Includes a “q to quit” hint at the bottom.\n  – The table header now shows “\u003CDirectoryName> Repositories”.\n* Show a “Found X repositories, loading…” message with a simple animated dots indicator while gathering statuses.\n\n* tested on macOS / Node
