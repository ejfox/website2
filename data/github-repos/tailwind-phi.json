This plugin gives you a set of magic numbers, baked into Tailwind utilities, that you can mix into your existing designs to make them feel more harmonious.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c51671f4-ea68-42f9-8a81-a34258094c23)\n\n```bash\nnpm install tailwind-phi\n```\n\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    require('tailwind-phi')\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## How to Think About It\n\nRather than replacing your existing Tailwind classes, `tailwind-phi` adds new ones you can use strategically:\n\n- Use `grid-cols-phi-fixed` when you want that perfect content-sidebar split that just feels right\n- Drop `text-phi` and friends into your typography system where you need naturally progressive size jumps\n- Grab `aspect-phi` when you need an image container that's pleasing to the eye\n- Try the `phi-thirds` layout when you need three columns but want them to feel balanced\n\nThe golden ratio isn't about strict rules - it's about having good proportions in your back pocket when you need them.\n\n## Design Tips\n\n- Mix it with your existing spacing system. Use Tailwind's standard `gap-*` with `grid-cols-phi-fixed` for example\n- The golden ratio works great for main/aside divisions (main content vs sidebar) \n- Try `phi`-based spacing around your most important content - it creates subtle emphasis\n- The typography scale works beautifully for article or blog layouts\n- When something feels slightly off in your layout, try swapping in a `phi`-based proportion\n\nSee the [live demo](https://github.com/yourusername/tailwind-phi/demo) for the full utility reference and detailed examples.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <h1>tailwind-φ</h1>\n  <p>The golden ratio, served à la carte for your designs ✨</p>\n</div>\n\nNature's most beautiful proportion (φ ≈ 1.618034) is now available as a carefully curated set of Tailwind utilities.
