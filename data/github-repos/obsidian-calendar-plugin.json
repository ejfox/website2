For example, if you don't like how bright the title is, you can override it with:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">#calendar-container .year {\n  color: var(--text-normal);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> It's especially important when overriding the classes to prefix them with <code>#calendar-container</code> to avoid any unexpected changes within Obsidian!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"caution-to-theme-creators\">Caution to Theme Creators</h3>\n<p>If you use \"Inspect Element\" on the calendar, you will notice that the CSS classes are quite illegible. For example: <code>.task.svelte-1lgyrog.svelte-1lgyrog</code>. What's going on here? The classes that begin with <code>svelte-</code> are autogenerated and are used to avoid the calendar styles affecting any other elements in the app. That being said: <strong>ignore them!</strong> Those CSS classes are likely to change from release to release, and your overrides <em>will</em> break. Just target the human-readable part of the class names. So to override <code>task.svelte-1lgyrog.svelte-1lgyrog</code>, you should use <code>#calendar-container .task { ... }</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h2>\n<p><code>obsidian-calendar-plugin</code> currently requires Obsidian v0.9.11 or above to work properly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<p>You can install the plugin via the Community Plugins tab within Obsidian. Just search for \"Calendar.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"faq\">FAQ</h2>\n<h3 id=\"what-do-the-dots-mean\">What do the dots mean?</h3>\n<p>Each solid dot represents 250 words in your daily note. So 4 dots means you've written a thousands words for that day! If you want to change that threshold, you can set a different value for \"Words Per Dot\" in the Calendar settings.</p>\n<p>The hollow dots, on the other hand, mean that the day has incomplete tasks in it. (<strong>Note:</strong> There will only ever be 1 hollow dot on a particular day, regardless of the number of remaining tasks)</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-i-change-the-styling-of-the-calendar\">How do I change the styling of the Calendar?</h3>\n<p>By default, the calendar should seamlessly match your theme, but if you'd like to further customize it, you can! In your <code>obsidian.css</code> file (inside your vault) you can configure the styling to your heart's content.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-add-week-numbers-to-the-calendar\">Can I add week numbers to the calendar?</h3>\n<p>In the settings, you can enable \"Show Week Numbers\" to add a \"week number\" column to the calendar. Click on the week number to open a \"weekly note\".</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-i-hide-the-calendar-plugin-without-disabling-the-plugin\">How do I hide the calendar plugin without disabling the plugin?</h3>\n<p>Just like other sidebar views (e.g. Backlinks, Outline), the calendar view can be closed by right-clicking on the view icon.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./images/how-to-close.png\" alt=\"how-to-close\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"i-accidentally-closed-the-calendar-how-do-i-reopen-it\">I accidentally closed the calendar.

This tells <a href=\"https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/\">moment</a> to ignore the words. So for the example above, you would set your format to <code>[Week] ww [of Year] gggg</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-dont-like-showing-the-week-numbers-but-i-still-want-to-use-weekly-notes-can-i-still-use-them\">I don't like showing the week numbers but I still want to use weekly notes.

(This is helpful for when you need to backfill old notes or if you're planning ahead for future notes! This will use your current **daily note** template!)\n- Visualize your writing. Each day includes a meter to approximate how much you've written that day.\n- Use **Weekly notes** for an added organization layer! They work just like daily notes, but have their own customization options.\n\n## Settings\n\n- **Start week on [default: locale]**: Configure the Calendar view to show Sunday or Monday as the first day of the week. Choosing 'locale' will set the start day to be whatever is the default for your chosen locale (`Settings > About > Language`)\n- **Words per Dot [default: 250]**: Starting in version 1.3, dots reflect the word count of your files. By default, each dot represents 250 words, you can change that value to whatever you want. Set this to `0` to disable the word count entirely. **Note:** There is a max of 5 dots so that the view doesn't get too big!\n- **Confirm before creating new note [default: on]**: If you don't like that a modal prompts you before creating a new daily note, you can turn it off.\n- **Show Week Number [default: off]**: Enable this to add a new column to the calendar view showing the [Week Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week#Week_numbering). Clicking on these cells will open your **weekly note**.\n\n## Customization\n\nThe following CSS Variables can be overridden in your `obsidian.css` file.\n\n```css\n/* obsidian-calendar-plugin */\n/* https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin */\n\n#calendar-container {\n  --color-background-heading: transparent;\n  --color-background-day: transparent;\n  --color-background-weeknum: transparent;\n  --color-background-weekend: transparent;\n\n  --color-dot: var(--text-muted);\n  --color-arrow: var(--text-muted);\n  --color-button: var(--text-muted);\n\n  --color-text-title: var(--text-normal);\n  --color-text-heading: var(--text-muted);\n  --color-text-day: var(--text-normal);\n  --color-text-today: var(--interactive-accent);\n  --color-text-weeknum: var(--text-muted);\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to the CSS Variables, there are some classes you can override for further customization. For example, if you don't like how bright the title is, you can override it with:\n\n```css\n#calendar-container .year {\n  color: var(--text-normal);\n}\n```\n\n> **Note:** It's especially important when overriding the classes to prefix them with `#calendar-container` to avoid any unexpected changes within Obsidian!\n\n### Caution to Theme Creators\n\nIf you use \"Inspect Element\" on the calendar, you will notice that the CSS classes are quite illegible.
