    "raw": "# Directory Sync Tool\n\nA command-line interface tool for comparing and synchronizing directories.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis tool is designed to help you maintain consistency between two directories, particularly useful when you have a source of truth (like a content management system) and a target directory (like a published website) that needs to stay in sync.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **Blog Management**: Sync your local markdown files with your published blog posts.\n2. **Website Deployment**: Ensure your production site matches your development environment.\n3. **Content Synchronization**: Keep multiple content directories in sync across different platforms or devices.\n4. **Backup Verification**: Compare a backup directory with its source to ensure all files are accounted for.\n\n## When to Use\n\n- Before deploying website updates\n- After bulk content creation or deletion\n- During content migration between systems\n- As part of a regular maintenance routine for your digital content\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g directory-sync-tool\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nRun the tool:\n\n```bash\ndstool\n```\n\nThe tool will prompt you to select a source and target directory. It then identifies files present in the target but not in the source, allowing you to delete or ignore these discrepancies.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- Interactive directory selection\n- File comparison between source and target\n- Options to delete or ignore files\n- Customizable default paths via environment variables\n\n## Controls\n\n- Arrow keys: Navigate\n- Enter: Select\n- 'd': Delete file from target\n- 'i': Ignore file\n- 'q': Quit\n- 'e': Easter egg (because even serious tools can have a bit of fun)\n\n## Configuration\n\nSet default paths in your environment or .env file:\n\n```\nSOURCE_PATH=/path/to/your/source\nTARGET_PATH=/path/to/your/target\n```\n\n## Why It's Useful\n\n- Saves time by automating file comparisons\n- Reduces human error in manual file management\n- Provides a clear interface for decision-making about file discrepancies\n- Helps maintain data integrity across multiple locations\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Always verify your source and target directories before making changes\n- Use the tool as part of a broader backup and synchronization strategy\n- Regularly check for updates to ensure you have the latest features and security patches\n\n## Contributing\n\nFound a bug or have a feature request?
