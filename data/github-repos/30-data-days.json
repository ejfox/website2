It is a great example of how constraints can inspire creativity. There are similar common projects in other fields, such as [30 days of photography](http://expertphotography.com/30-day-photography-challenge/) or the [30 day journal project](http://www.lisasonora.com/30-day-journal-project/). It would be great to do something similar in our chosen field of dataviz.\n\n# The Goals\n+ The limits should inspire us.

The goal is to have at least 7 participants, so everyone has at least 7 days between visualizations to think of and work on their ideas. If we can have more than 7, even better. \n- [ ] One dataset is chosen by the group.\n+  Each day's visualization will consist of an .html file and a .js file and (optionally) a .css file- both of which will be numbered by the day.
