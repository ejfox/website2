We draft maps of embeddings via a combination of node scripts, python notebooks and Observable notebooks.\n\n\n## Embed any csv\n\nIf you have a csv file where you'd like to embed the text in a given column, you can do so with this command:\n~~~bash\nnode embed-csv.mjs <filename> <text column> <id column>\n~~~\nIf there is no id column it will use the row # in the input csv as the id. It expects the csv file to be in the data/ directory.\n\n## Reddit embeddings\n\nYou can download up to 1000 top posts for any subreddit via the reddit API. We then embed the title and selftext for all the posts.\n\n~~~bash\n# download the top 1000 posts for DataIsBeautiful\nnode reddit-posts.js dataisbeautiful fetch 1000\n\n#embed the posts\nnode reddit-embeddings.js dataisbeautiful\n~~~\n\nThen we can dimensionality reduce it with UMAP and cluster with HDBSCAN\n\nsee `jupyter/Reddit umap.ipynb`\n\nThen we can also generate labels for our clusters:\n\n~~~bash\nnode cluster-labels.mjs dataisbeautiful\n~~~\n\nThe results of this process aren't committed to the repo but can be explored here:\nhttps://observablehq.com/@codingwithfire/dataisbeautiful-top-posts\n\n\n## Simonw Blog entries\nSimon Willison publishes a [popular blog on technology](https://simonwillison.net/), and he also [published embeddings](https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog/blog_entry_embeddings) of his almost 3000 blog posts.\n\nThe process is done in `jupyter/simonw umap.ipynb`\n\nThe map can be seen here:\nhttps://observablehq.com/@codingwithfire/simonw-blog-entry-map\n\n",
