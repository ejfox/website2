    "raw": "# Nuxt + Cloudinary Photo Gallery App\n\nThis README document describes the development of a custom media organizing and publishing application using bash scripts, Apple Automator, and Cloudinary on a Nuxt.js framework.\n\n## What is this project about?\n\nThis project arose from the author's need for a better way to organize and publish media files. Frustrated with existing solutions, a unique process of organizing and publishing photos using existing tools and some custom scripting was developed. The project focuses on an organized file system that starts with the `~/dump/` directory where all new media is initially saved and subsequently moved to organized directories in `~/media/` and finally uploaded to Cloudinary.\n\n## The Project Process:\n\n1. **Import SD Card to `~/dump/`**: Apple Automator and bash scripting are used to handle the importation of files from SD cards into the `~/dump/` directory. Only specific file types (JPEG, MP3, MP4, RAF, WAV) are selected for copying.\n2. **Organize `~/dump/` into `~/media/`:** When `~/dump/` grows too large, another script is run which moves everything in `~/dump/` into organized sub-folders in `~/media/`, based on their creation date and file type. Log files of the operations are created and stored in the same directory.\n3. **Upload to Cloudinary:** After the local organization is completed, the media files tagged in green are uploaded to Cloudinary using a bash script that detects the tags, navigates to the correct directory, and executes the upload command.\n\n## Web Interface with Nuxt.js:\n\nThe files stored on Cloudinary are fetched back for viewing on a web interface built with Nuxt.js. Server-side coding is implemented to securely access Cloudinary with private keys and retrieve the media. It also features a Nuxt Server API which fetches the latest photos when the endpoint `/api/latest-photos` is accessed.\n\nOverall, this is a fully functional and efficient media organizing system that follows the author's personalized approach to manage a large collection of files and present them in an organized and pleasant web gallery built on Nuxt.js.\n\nLook at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.\n\n## Setup\n\nMake sure to install the dependencies:\n\n```bash\n# yarn\nyarn install\n```\n\n## Development Server\n\nStart the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:\n\n```bash\n# yarn\nyarn dev\n```\n\n## Production\n\nBuild the application for production:\n\n```bash\n# yarn\nyarn build\n```\n\nLocally preview production build:\n\n```bash\n# yarn\nyarn preview\n```\n\nCheck out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.\n\n## API Endpoints\n\n### `/api/cloudinary-lite-info`\n\nThis endpoint retrieves lite information about all photos stored in Cloudinary.\n\n#### Request Method:\n\n- `GET`\n\n#### Response:\n\nThe response will be a JSON array containing objects with the following fields for each photo:\n\n- `public_id`: The unique identifier for the photo in Cloudinary.\n- `secure_url`: The secure URL to access the photo.\n- `created_at`: The date and time when the photo was uploaded.\n\n#### Example Response:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"public_id\": \"sample_photo_1\",\n    \"secure_url\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/v123456/sample_photo_1.jpg\",\n    \"created_at\": \"2023-01-01T12:00:00Z\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"public_id\": \"sample_photo_2\",\n    \"secure_url\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/v123456/sample_photo_2.jpg\",\n    \"created_at\": \"2023-01-02T12:00:00Z\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis endpoint is useful for fetching a summary of all photos for analytics, such as totals, counts, and grouping by month stats.\n",
