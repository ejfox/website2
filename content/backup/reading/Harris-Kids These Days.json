On the other hand, were someone to push the American oligarchy off its ledge, the shove seems likely to come from this side of the generation gap, and we will have become the first generation of successful American revolutionaries.

The better workers get, the more money and time we put into building up our human capital, the worse the jobs get. And that’s a big problem because, as we’ve seen over the last two chapters, America is producing some damn good workers. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=963\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">963</a> ^ref-49679</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Employers didn’t just awake one day and decide to treat their workers worse. Capitalism encourages owners to reduce their labor costs until it becomes unprofitable. The minimum wage exists to put an extramarket basement on how low the purchasers of labor can drive the price. As Chris Rock famously put it: “Do you know what it means when someone pays you minimum wage? I would pay you less, but it’s against the law.” — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=1266\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1266</a> ^ref-19180</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">There’s also a cultural aspect: Kids trained from infancy to excel and compete to their fullest potential under all circumstances are ill-suited for traditional union tactics that sometimes require intentionally inefficient work, like the slowdown strike or work-to-rule.

What this three-party relationship means is that students are paying their colleges and working for companies (or the state or nonprofits), and in return both will confirm for anyone who asks that the student indeed paid for the credits and performed the labor. Interns are like Danny Dunn, getting paid in homework stickers. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=1325\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1325</a> ^ref-53403</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">In the 1940 cohort, approximately 90 percent out-earned their parents. But for Millennials, the mobility number is down to 50 percent: It’s a coin-flip whether or not we’ll out-earn Mom and Dad.41 The analysts conclude that the drastic change comes from the shifting, increasingly unequal distribution of GDP, rather than a lack of growth itself.

The law is effective at incentivizing school administrations to meet their yearly progress goals, but that’s not the same as incentivizing them to improve instruction or learning. Instead, it’s about compelling schools to generate the right kind of data. The state accepts these assessment reports as valid representations of educational quality, so administrators and teachers—and most of all, students—have to generate the right reports. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=1626\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1626</a> ^ref-2477</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Classrooms and teachers that look alike on paper might very well be totally different in ways the test can’t see.

They think once every school is on the same page, they can turn up output like they’re producing bottle caps or bars of steel. If employers need a lot of skilled workers, then the state will provide. The workers might not be happy, but they’ll know how to work. For kids who don’t (or can’t) fit the mold, however, getting along has become more difficult. We can draw a straight line between the standardization of children in educational reform and the expulsion, arrest, and even murder of the kids who won’t adapt. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=1695\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1695</a> ^ref-57339</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Bringing the police into schools to patrol the hallways and intervene in noncriminal matters, along with the increased use of suspensions, is an intensification of school discipline, analogous to the intensification of the production of human capital. The system is geared to churn out more skilled workers, but it’s also meant to produce prisoners. This harsh reality lurks behind every “joke” all the teachers, counselors, and administrators tell their students about ending up in prison if they don’t work hard. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=1748\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1748</a> ^ref-40828</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">America’s criminal justice system needs lives to process, and our schools are obliging by marking more kids as bad, sometimes even turning them over directly to the authorities. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=1753\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1753</a> ^ref-2998</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Instead of imagining that the current state of school discipline is a malfunction in a fundamentally benevolent system, it seems more likely that one of the education system’s functions is to exclude some kids. When I look at school discipline in the context of declining violence and a lack of evidence that suspensions are effective at improving students’ learning conditions, I can only conclude that the actual purpose of such discipline, at a structural level, is to label and remove black kids (disproportionately) from the clearly defined road to college and career. Just as they have increased human capital production, schools have increased the production of future prisoners, channeling kids from attendance to lockdown. The school system isn’t an ineffective solution to racial and economic inequality, it’s an effective cause. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=1764\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1764</a> ^ref-5230</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">The problem with the relationship between poor black and brown children and the state, liberals contend, is that it’s not tight enough.

Nuisance policing comes down hard on young people, given as they are to cavorting in front of others. Kids don’t own space anywhere, so much of their socializing takes place in public. The police are increasingly unwilling to cede any space at all to kids, providing state reinforcement for zero-risk childhood. What a few decades ago might have been looked upon as normal adolescent hijinks—running around a mall, horsing around on trains, or drinking beer in a park at night—is now fuel for the cat-and-mouse police games that Victor Rios describes.

This is no surprise given the age cohort that owns and manages media companies. But Boomers are their own special group of Americans, with their own predilections. The Wall Street Journal broke down the numbers on accidental drug overdoses over time by age and didn’t find a consistent pattern: In the early 1970s, fifteen-to-twenty-four-year-olds overdosed most, then it was young and middle-aged adults, and now the forty-five-to-sixty-four-year-olds have taken over.49 It didn’t make much sense, until they looked at how the Boomer cohort traveled through those numbers. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=2704\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">2704</a> ^ref-876</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Perhaps increased anxiety and depression means decreased teen libidos, or maybe it’s a side effect of the medication.

Human capital is the government’s largest financial asset and the population’s largest source of debt that isn’t backed by land. But right now, with the student lending system nationalized, private capital is more or less locked out of the market. Capitalists could invest in workers as employees, but that’s risky, as employees are free to go work elsewhere. What they want is to invest in workers as capital, to get a return no matter where the worker works, the way the government gets returns on student loans now. And if they invest in the next Zuckerberg, they want a piece of that multibillion-dollar upside, not just a 4 percent return. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=2850\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">2850</a> ^ref-52505</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Making school blatantly preprofessional dispenses with nice fuzzy liberal notions of what education is for, but it’s easy to see how a childhood spent preparing for a secure career in, say, home electronics repair might be more enjoyable than being set up to fail in a giant contest for a tiny number of really good lives. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=2874\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">2874</a> ^ref-12103</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">The algorithms see us less as individuals than as confluences of probabilities.

The police are increasingly unwilling to cede any space at all to kids, providing state reinforcement for zero-risk childhood.

It takes idle hands to get past first base, and today’s kids have a lot to do. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=2736\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">2736</a> ^ref-41330</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">We’ve seen how central workers’ ability to work has become to the economy, and to the lives of young Americans. Human capital is the government’s largest financial asset and the population’s largest source of debt that isn’t backed by land. But right now, with the student lending system nationalized, private capital is more or less locked out of the market. Capitalists could invest in workers as employees, but that’s risky, as employees are free to go work elsewhere. What they want is to invest in workers as capital, to get a return no matter where the worker works, the way the government gets returns on student loans now. And if they invest in the next Zuckerberg, they want a piece of that multibillion-dollar upside, not just a 4 percent return. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=2850\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">2850</a> ^ref-52505</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Making school blatantly preprofessional dispenses with nice fuzzy liberal notions of what education is for, but it’s easy to see how a childhood spent preparing for a secure career in, say, home electronics repair might be more enjoyable than being set up to fail in a giant contest for a tiny number of really good lives. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=2874\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">2874</a> ^ref-12103</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">The algorithms see us less as individuals than as confluences of probabilities. We don’t have races per se, we have “ethnic affiliations” based on how our observed behavior compares to large data sets of other people’s observed behavior. Americans will understand less and less the exact ways in which we’re being profiled and discriminated against (or in favor of), and even when we do know, we’ll have a hard time proving it. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=2907\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">2907</a> ^ref-50437</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">My real fear is that authorities will find a way to break down the perceptual distinction between being alive and doing work. Maybe it will be Black Mirror’s rows of treadmills, but I’m thinking more like very advanced video game design. Tech enthusiast Shane Snow controversially suggested that we’d be better off if prison inmates were just sucking on Soylent dispensers and living through Oculus headsets.3 Giving asylum inmates games to play all day will seem generous, and if we can somehow extract value from their playing (the way Google uses CAPTCHA verification to gather street addresses for their Maps program), then it’s a win-win, at least compared to incarceration as it exists. This puts us on the Matrix path, where living in reality is itself a privilege. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=2924\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">2924</a> ^ref-61645</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Jodi Dean, Blog Theory: Feedback and Capture in the Circuits of Drive, Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, 2010, pp. 3– — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B06XFTVQFK&#x26;location=3591\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">3591</a> ^ref-31539</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>",
