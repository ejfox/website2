They were not to refuse help to a colleague, regardless of his rank or department, when it might be necessary. And perhaps most important, the supervisor was authorized to guide, not interfere with, the people he (or she) managed. “The management style was, and remained for many years, to use the lightest touch and absolutely never to compete with underlings,” — location: <a href=\"\" class=\"prose-lg text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1701</a> ^ref-21560</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll opacity-0\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">As Jack Morton had said, if you hadn’t sold anything you hadn’t innovated, and without an affordable price you could never sell anything. — location: <a href=\"\" class=\"prose-lg text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1900</a> ^ref-62115</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll opacity-0\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">ALL WRITTEN AND SPOKEN EXCHANGES, to some degree, depend on code—the symbolic letters on the page, or the sounds of consonants and vowels that are transmitted (encoded) by our voices and received (decoded) by our ears and minds. With each passing decade, modern technology has tended to push everyday written and spoken exchanges ever deeper into the realm of ciphers, symbols, and electronically enhanced puzzles of representation. — location: <a href=\"\" class=\"prose-lg text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">2111</a> ^ref-36325</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll opacity-0\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">One of his paper’s underlying tenets, Shannon would later say, “is that information can be treated very much like a physical quantity, such as mass or energy.” — location: <a href=\"\" class=\"prose-lg text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">2144</a> ^ref-47480</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll opacity-0\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">The bit, Shannon explained, “corresponds to the information produced when a choice is made from two equally likely possibilities.
