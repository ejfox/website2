I am fascinated by them. I love humans and humanity as a whole, but if you want to start going one by one we're going to run into problems. I spend my free time, when the light is good, walking around New York and photographing strangers. When the light is bad, I sketch them. The whole time I am pumping podcasts into my ears.
