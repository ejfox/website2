These glitches in LLM-land are often referred to as <a href=\"\" class=\"prose-lg text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">hallucinations</a> although, much like the phrase “AI Researcher” I fear this term obscures as much as it illuminates.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll opacity-0\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Sydney was a shot across the bow, and the industry as a whole seemed undaunted.

Why, exactly, was Microsoft’s Robot behaving in such strange ways?

Say you are a mathematician trying to understand the patterns of english, the first thing you’re going to want to do is turn the ugly mud of human language into beautiful numbers that you can perform equations on. This is done through a process of tokenization, where a bunch of text is read by an AI system (separate from the final LLM), which looks at commonly repeated letters and words and turns them into their own atomic units, ready to be disassembled and reassembled later.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll opacity-0\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Given an afternoon, a few humans with a whiteboard could probably assemble a few thousand of the top-most used words by hand; “a”, “the”, “and”, and so on. For the initial versions of GPT-3 and its cousin, GPT-J, the token set had about 50,000 entries consisting of small words or parts of words.</p>\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1729471657/Tokenization-1.png\" class=\"dark:invert w-full max-w-full mx-auto opacity-0 transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out pr-2 py-2 md:pr-6 md:py-4 lg:pr-12 lg:py-6 animate-on-scroll slide-from-bottom will-change-transform\" alt=\"Tokenization transforms human language into digestible units for AI.\">\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll opacity-0\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">50k is a lot of entries, but if they had cared to look, the creators would have discovered that lurking in their huge list were errant, strange tokens, that no human would ever write in their entire lives.
