# What I'm doing now

**Work:** Focusing on data visualization projects at room302.studio, particularly exploring new ways to make complex datasets more accessible and engaging. Currently working on several client projects involving climate data and urban planning visualizations.

**Learning:** Diving deeper into WebGL and Three.js for more interactive data visualizations. Also exploring the intersection of AI and data storytelling.

**Writing:** Working on a series of posts about the evolution of data journalism and how new tools are changing the way we tell stories with data.

**Personal:** Reading "The Art of Not Being Governed" by James C. Scott, practicing pottery, and taking more walks around the neighborhood.

**Tools:** Recently switched to using Claude Code for development work, which has been a game-changer for productivity.
