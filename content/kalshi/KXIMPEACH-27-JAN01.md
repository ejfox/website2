This isn't a partisan bet - it's a structural one. The impeachment mechanism has become a routine political tool rather than an extraordinary constitutional remedy. The pattern since 2019 suggests impeachment is now weaponized theater.

Whether it happens depends less on Trump's actions and more on Congressional power dynamics. With margins this thin, any scandal becomes impeachment fuel. The system is designed to escalate, not de-escalate.

Small position size reflects high uncertainty in timeline, but strong belief in directional trend.
