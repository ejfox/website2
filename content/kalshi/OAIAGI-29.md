Betting NO because I believe AGI requires more than scaled transformers. The current paradigm is jazz musicians riffing on patterns, not composers creating new forms. Intelligence needs embodiment, feedback loops with reality, not just statistical pattern matching.

OpenAI's marketing will call anything "AGI" when convenient, but true general intelligence requires solving the hard problem of grounding - connecting symbols to meaning through interaction with the world. LLMs are phenomenal tools, but they're not thinking.

This is my largest position because it represents a core belief about the nature of intelligence itself.
