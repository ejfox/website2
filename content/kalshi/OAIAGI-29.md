Took a NO position betting OpenAI won't officially declare "AGI" before 2029.

**Core reasoning:**

The term "AGI" has no consensus definition in the field. What OpenAI (or the market resolution source) considers "AGI" is fundamentally subjective. Even if GPT-5 or GPT-6 demonstrates remarkable capabilities, OpenAI has strong incentives to *delay* an official "AGI achieved" announcement:

- **Safety narrative**: Claiming AGI = claiming extremely dangerous tech = regulatory scrutiny
- **Competitive dynamics**: "AGI achieved" invites questions about whether competitors (Anthropic, Google) have also achieved it
- **Moving goalposts**: Sam Altman has repeatedly redefined AGI criteria as models improve

**What I'm actually betting on:**

Not that AI progress will slow, but that **the official marketing/PR decision** to declare "AGI" will be delayed for strategic reasons unrelated to technical capability. This is a bet on organizational behavior, not technology.

**Alternative scenarios where I lose:**

- OpenAI faces existential competitive pressure and needs an "AGI achieved" announcement for fundraising/talent
- Internal definition becomes public and a model clearly meets it
- Market resolution criteria end up being more lenient than expected

**Meta-lesson:** Markets on vague definitions ("AGI", "recession", "woke") trade more on consensus interpretation than objective reality. The profitable edge is in understanding *who decides* and *what their incentives are*.
