Largest position by contract count because this feels inevitable. Not IF but WHEN someone gets caught submitting AI-written work as human-authored in a high-stakes context.

Academia, journalism, creative industries - all have incentive structures that reward human creativity but can't reliably detect AI generation. The authentication crisis is already here; we just haven't had the watershed moment yet.

This market resolves cultural tension between:
1. AI tools are legitimate aids
2. Passing AI work as human is fraud
3. No reliable way to distinguish them

That contradiction must rupture publicly in 2025. Too many people are already quietly using AI, too many institutions are unprepared to handle it.
