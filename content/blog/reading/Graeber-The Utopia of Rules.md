# The Utopia of Rules

* ISBN: 1612193749

## Highlights
> The Right, at least, has a critique of bureaucracy. It’s not a very good one. But at least it exists. The Left has none. As a result, when those who identify with the Left do have anything negative to say about bureaucracy, they are usually forced to adopt a watered-down version of the right-wing critique. ^ref-31464

---
> The mercantile classes in the Middle Ages undermined the old feudal order like termites munching from below—termites, yes, but the good kind. ^ref-44756

---
> In most times and places, the way one goes about doing something is assumed to be the ultimate expression of who one is. ^ref-62935
