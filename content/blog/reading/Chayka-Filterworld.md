# Filterworld

* ISBN: 1788708547

## Highlights
> Algorithmic recommendations are the latest iteration of the Mechanical Turk: a series of human decisions that have been dressed up and automated as technological ones, at an inhuman scale and speed. ^ref-28483

---
> Filterworld is the culture of presets, established patterns that get repeated again and again. The technology limits us to certain modes of consumption; you can’t stray outside of the lines. “Maniac fun,” as Yuri says, is gone—that is to say, a certain degree of originality, unprecedentedness, creativity, and surprise disappears when so much weighs on culture’s ability to spread through digital feeds. ^ref-10006

---
> In other words, anything that can be turned into something like data—a series of numbers—could be manipulated in a formulaic way. That might include text, music, art, or even a game like chess. ^ref-2664

---
> the law is its own kind of algorithm, ^ref-52064
