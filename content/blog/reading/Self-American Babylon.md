# American Babylon



## Highlights
> Dedicated enemies of organized labor, the welfare state, and radical politics of all varieties, the Knowlands helped to set the political tone for many of the city’s other downtown property owners, their patrons and guardians, and those with a vested interest in downtown as a site of capital accumulation. ^ref-42512

---
> In this sense, the postwar black struggle in America represented one of the world’s most sustained and militant engagements with the modern state apparatus.13 ^ref-13476
