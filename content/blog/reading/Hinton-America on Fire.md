* ISBN: 1631498908

## Highlights
> Yet they often concluded that “rioting” was a pathological impulse, rooted in spontaneous, uncontrollable emotion. In this view, the “riots” were ultimately counter-productive: the violence only alienated allies and intensified anti-Black sentiment. ^ref-54936

---
> The 1968 legislation, with its additional $400 million outlay (or about $3 billion today) for crime control, allowed cities to flood with police those urban areas that seemed prone to rebellion. By 1970, federal policymakers had allocated some $40 million worth (or about $300 million today) of military-grade equipment for local law enforcement. ^ref-53027

---
> They looked back on the heyday of the civil rights movement, and they looked at the conditions they were currently living in, with police watching them from the other side of the park, and they rebelled. ^ref-40007

---
> The national strategy set the tone, even in places that did not receive federal funds. Policing became more aggressive and intrusive in Black communities everywhere. Police often claimed to be responding to a tip, which the newspapers later reported to justify the officers’ actions and their presence in the community in the first place. ^ref-31253
