# The Education of a Photographer

* ISBN: 158115450X

## Highlights
> One should shoot the subject from several different points and in varying positions in different photographs, as if encompassing it—not peer through one keyhole. Don’t make photo-pictures, make photo-moments of documentary (not artistic) value. ^ref-27110

---
> It seems to me it would be pretty difficult to be a portrait photographer for customers who order and pay since, apart from a Maecenas or two, they want to be flattered, and the result is no longer real. ^ref-44744
