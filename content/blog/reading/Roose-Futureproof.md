James Wilson, two executives at the consulting firm Accenture, write in their book Human + Machine that human-AI collaborations will be a cornerstone of the twenty-first-century economy. “AI systems are not wholesale replacing us,” they write. “Rather, they are amplifying our skills and collaborating with us to achieve productivity gains that have previously not been possible.” ^ref-7964
