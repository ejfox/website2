# Visualize This



## Highlights
> There was one day when my only goal was to verify three numbers in a dataset, because when The New York Times graphics desk creates a graphic, it makes sure what it reports is accurate. Only after we knew the data was reliable did we move on to the presentation. Itâ€™s this attention to detail that makes its graphics so good. ^ref-18691

> A label or legend can completely mess up the vibe of a piece of work, but at the least, you can include some information in a short description paragraph. It helps others appreciate your efforts. ^ref-42545
