# After the Prophet



## Highlights
> The first line of attack in this campaign was poetry. ^ref-45180

---
> His personal physician, Ibn Uthal, a Christian and a noted alchemist, was an expert on poisons, as was his successor, Abu al-Hakam, also a Christian. Their records no longer exist, but Ibn Washiyaâ€™s Book on Poisons, written in ninth-century Baghdad as a guide for his son, has survived. ^ref-53577

---
> The Sunnis, in effect, would honor history as it had taken shape; the Shia would honor it as they believe it should have taken shape, and as they maintain it indeed did in a realm other than the worldly one. ^ref-9602
