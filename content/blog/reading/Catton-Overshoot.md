# Overshoot

* ISBN: 0252009886

## Highlights
> Today mankind is locked into stealing ravenously from the future. ^ref-8368

---
> Man has recognized the many-faceted interdependence of diverse organisms, their impact upon their habitat, their impermanence, and their inability to foresee and evade the processes leading to their own displacement by successors. ^ref-45341

---
> The paramount need of post-exuberant humanity is to remain human in the face of dehumanizing pressures. To do this we must learn somehow to base exuberance of spirit upon something more lasting than the expansive living that sustained it in the recent past. But, as if we were driving a car that has become stuck on a muddy road, we feel an urge to bear down harder than ever on the accelerator and to spin our wheels vigorously in an effort to power ourselves out of the quagmire. This reflex will only dig us in deeper. ^ref-27356

---
> Let us begin with the fact that all the many forms of life on this planet have the same ultimate chemical basis. In many and varied ways, their life processes are also interdependent. Each form (including man) takes certain substances from its environment and puts certain substances into its environment; these affect other organisms. The influences of various species upon each other are often intricate, indirect, and subtle. ^ref-19726
