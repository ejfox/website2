# Notes of a Native Son

* ISBN: 0807006238

## Highlights
> I am what time, circumstance, history, have made of me, certainly, but I am, also, much more than that. So are we all. ^ref-16622

---
> The only real change vividly discernible in this present, unspeakably dangerous chaos is a panic-stricken apprehension on the part of those who have maligned and subjugated others for so long that the tables have been turned. Not once have the Civilized been able to honor, recognize, or describe the Savage. He is, practically speaking, the source of their wealth, his continued subjugation the key to their power and glory. ^ref-46425
