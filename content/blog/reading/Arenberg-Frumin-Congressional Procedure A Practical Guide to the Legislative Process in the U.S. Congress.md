# Congressional Procedure: A Practical Guide to the Legislative Process in the U.S. Congress

* ISBN: 158733299X

## Highlights
> Arenberg ends his book by linking Congress’s current failures back to the fundamentals of democracy. He argues, as I would, that “Our democratic process operates on the assumption that both parties will come to the table and negotiate in good faith. Congress must negotiate, moderate, and compromise. In other words, ‘legislate.’” ^ref-30463
