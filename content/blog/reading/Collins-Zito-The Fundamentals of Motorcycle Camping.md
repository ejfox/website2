# The Fundamentals of Motorcycle Camping



## Highlights
> It just makes sense that motorcycles and camping go hand in hand. The same sensory connection to the world we get from motorcycling—the same elements we love, of being in the wind and leaning through the curves—can take place around camp. This both adds to your motorcycle adventures and contributes an entirely new passion to the mix. ^ref-29222

---
> I like to set up camp in a way that creates the perfect opening scene to the movie I am recording as a memory. I place the bike just right, against a beautiful vista as a backdrop, noting where the sun will make its first appearance and angling my tent in an ideal way. This is like a gift for me to open in the morning. ^ref-4396

---
> They can be found by either checking with the land management bureau or by venturing into a national forest and turning down a dirt road to search for one. Word of mouth is another great way to find these; talk to locals and others camping in the area to find out the best spots. ^ref-18277

---
> Make sure you are covering the common roadside troubles, that are not only likely but also possible to fix on the side of the road. The most likely problems to encounter are tire punctures, broken chains, fuses, batteries, cables (brake and clutch), and fouled spark plugs. ^ref-7062

---
> This ice is especially dangerous on a motorcycle as you will have little to no control over the motorcycle when riding over it. The best course of action other than avoiding it completely, is to remain calm, avoid changes in speed or direction, and keep the bike as straight up as possible while passing over it. ^ref-25684
