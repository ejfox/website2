* ISBN: 0399169946

## Highlights
> Exterminate all the brutes, he thinks, remembering his Conrad. Exterminate all rational thought, he thinks, remembering his Burroughs. And between those two lines written sixty years apart, you have the entire canon of Western liter . . ^ref-14508

---
> No one ever accuses America of being a nation of historians. ^ref-3050

---
> Do I count whores when I count the number of women I’ve slept with? Do they count toward my number? Is it demeaning to them, antifeminist, not to count them as part of my total number of sexual partners? ^ref-6352

---
> He had pursued the life of a great writer because he wanted to be a great writer. Isn’t this what they did? Screw whores and get shot at and ingest large quantities of booze and drugs? ^ref-53033

---
> “A belief in war,” Justina says, “is like a belief in God. Comforting until you look too closely at the facts.” Peoria doesn’t quite know what to say, but he does know he should write this down. “Science,” Justina says, “science is a religion that can prove its miracles.” ^ref-25062

---
> A desire to be noticed and to criticize the criticizers of the world, to gain its acceptance by rejecting it, breeding a strange kind of apathy and nihilism and ambition, floating in a kind of morally barren world where they say, Look, here is the asshole’s asshole of the world, the New York media, and we will show you, minute by minute, post by post, what the rectum walls feel and taste like, and you will know even better these sensations because we ourselves are part ^ref-49766
