# Ideas in Food: Great Recipes and Why They Work

* ISBN: 0307717402

## Highlights
> Across the board, regardless of the recipe, we tend to season our food at a level of 0.5 percent of the weight of what we are cooking. There are a few exceptions where the level creeps up to 0.75 percent or down to 0.4 percent, but generally speaking, our palates are amazingly consistent. Now that we know this, when creating recipes we can calculate the necessary salt content based on the total weight of the ingredients, and we hit the bullâ€™s-eye every time. ^ref-58001
