### Highlights

When the spectacle [of society] stops talking about something for three days, it’s as if it didn’t exist. The spectacle has gone on to talk about something else, and now that is what exists. The practical consequences are enormous.” The disappearance of history is the primary source of the power of the spectacle. — location: [708](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0DGLSSTL3&location=708) ^ref-4551
