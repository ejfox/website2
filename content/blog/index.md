Hi there! I'm **EJ Fox**, a hacker-journalist using code and art to uncover hidden patterns. I try to use my skills to empower others to explore those connections. I believe the world is interconnected and editable, and by using technology for good we can empower people to change the world for the better. I founded [room302.studio](http://room302.studio), an innovation lab, to take on even larger projects and datasets. If you're interested in a fresh take on some data or just want to chat, reach out at [ejfox@ejfox.com](mailto:ejfox@ejfox.com) or [grab some time on my calendar](/calendar).

Or, if you'd like, browse [some of my work](/projects), read my [blog posts](/blog), or check out [my resume](http://ejfox.com/resume.pdf).
