# 2025 Predictions

This page contains my predictions for 2025, each cryptographically signed and timestamped.

## AI Predictions

### Prediction 1: Claude Achieves AGI
- **Confidence**: 15%
- **Deadline**: December 31, 2025
- **Description**: Claude or another major LLM will be widely considered to have achieved AGI by the ML research community
- **Reasoning**: Progress has been rapid, but AGI remains a high bar requiring breakthroughs in areas like long-term memory, reasoning, and generalization

### Prediction 2: Open Source Models Reach GPT-4 Level
- **Confidence**: 75%
- **Deadline**: December 31, 2025
- **Description**: At least one fully open-source model will match GPT-4's performance on standard benchmarks
- **Reasoning**: The gap between closed and open models continues to narrow, and there's strong incentive to develop competitive open alternatives

## Technology Predictions

### Prediction 3: Apple Vision Pro Sales Disappoint
- **Confidence**: 80%
- **Deadline**: December 31, 2025
- **Description**: Apple Vision Pro will sell less than 1 million units in 2025
- **Reasoning**: High price point, limited use cases, and the need for a killer app will constrain adoption

### Prediction 4: Crypto Winter Continues
- **Confidence**: 60%
- **Deadline**: December 31, 2025
- **Description**: Bitcoin will not exceed $70,000 at any point in 2025
- **Reasoning**: Regulatory pressure, environmental concerns, and lack of new use cases will keep crypto markets subdued

## Geopolitical Predictions

### Prediction 5: Russia-Ukraine War Continues
- **Confidence**: 85%
- **Deadline**: December 31, 2025
- **Description**: The Russia-Ukraine conflict will not have a formal peace agreement by end of 2025
