## Hong Kong Protest Techniques

- Traffic cones - to help contain tear gas cannisters
- Suitcases (as defenses)
- Water bottles
- Laser pointers
- Breaking bricks
- Using slingshots
- Transporting divider fencing
- Extinguishing tear gas with traffic cones and metal bowls
- Makeshift armor: saran wrap, garbage can lids, luggage = shields
- Organization - human supply chain lines
- Hand signals for when supplies are needed
- Parting crowds for ambulances
- Anonymous, leaderless
- Airdrop and signal/telegram chats for organization
- “Be like water” move quickly instead of occupying a single location
- Using trains and public transit to move quickly
