## ðŸŒŸ Overview of the Week


## Projects Worked On

### Draft Assistant `cli-content`

Created a [small CLI tool](https://github.com/ejfox/cli-content/blob/main/README.md) that looks at my drafts folder, shows me a few of my most recently-edited drafts and randomly picks some, and then lets me pick one to improve. It makes calls to the local LLM to generate some customized paths for improvement, and generates a few steps for improvement which the user can step through.
