### ðŸŒŸ Daily Check-In & Reflections

<!-- Note any physical activity, mindfulness practice, or self-care -->

#### Tuesday

I'm trying to untangle all of my ongoing projects. Like, a lot of things are at, like, 90% completion. And that final 10% is really difficult.

I was trying to share authentication between multiple projects using the same Supabase project, but that was causing all sorts of bugs. So I made new Supabase projects for a bunch of my projects which will hopefully make it easier to get them shippable.

I worked on debugging some - I'm really working towards making some demo videos ideally by the end of the week. I want, like, demo videos for all the projects. I want them to be usable MVPs, but even if they're not, we have videos of the features and the ideas that I was working towards.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ as a historical record.
