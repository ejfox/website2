### Daily Check-In & Reflections

#### Monday

Holiday, resting, playing Call of Duty with my friends.

#### Tuesday

I'm trying to untangle all of my ongoing projects. Like, a lot of things are at, like, 90% completion. And that final 10% is really difficult.

I was trying to share authentication between multiple projects using the same Supabase project, but that was causing all sorts of bugs. So I made new Supabase projects for a bunch of my projects which will hopefully make it easier to get them shippable.

I worked on debugging some - I'm really working towards making some demo videos ideally by the end of the week. I want, like, demo videos for all the projects. I want them to be usable MVPs, but even if they're not, we have videos of the features and the ideas that I was working towards.​​​​​​ as a historical record.

#### Wednesday

Made first contact with my future self today, breaking months of exercise inertia with a 0.57-mile winter runtime in 22°F weather (feels like 15°). Deployed Coach Artie docker successfully, fixed critical website issues, debugged Connectology's sim problems, and configured my digital augments (Apple Watch). Field tested winter run protocols with weight vest and boots - system response was optimal, discovered sustainable interval patterns without redlining. The fascists may have worked out today, but so did I. Momentum carrying into evening tasks. Physical protocols informing digital ones: sometimes the cleanest code comes after testing your limits in the cold. Todo list trembling before newfound energy. Earned these moonrocks.

#### Thursday

Successfully configured Loki to store logs in Cloudflare R2 (preventing VPS disk usage).

Built a Cloudflare Worker to transform Sentry's webhook format into Loki's expected format, though the final Sentry→Worker→Loki pipeline remains incomplete, will have to come back to that. Ideally client-side errors will all be sent to the same Grafana instance so I can see both frontend and backend errors across all my projects.

#### Friday

Went for a run. Got a new futuristic toothbrush in the mail. Watched bladerunner. Bought some new notebooks. Worried about the future of our country. The usual stuff.

#### Saturday

**Hexagram News:** Bought <https://hexagram.news> – picked some fonts out and got it pulling from a supabase table for the headlines. Need to work on automating the processes by which we add new headlines, but I'll save that for later.

### 📚 Learning & Media

<!-- Books, articles, movies, TV shows, podcasts consumed -->

This is the most insane MFA pin I've ever received.

Going back through old journal entries sometimes results in gems.
