### Code & Creations

### **THE EPIC QUEST TO DEPLOY A WEBSITE: A Tale of Code and Chaos**

1. **Months of Tireless Effort**: First, you’ve been grinding away on your personal site for weeks (maybe months?), crafting, tweaking, and perfecting the code into something truly worthy of the cyberpunk gods.

2. **Repository Hijinks**: Realizing the local `website2` repo wasn’t even on GitHub yet, you discovered a time capsule version of your site in an old `website2` repo, which is hilariously out of date. Cue existential sigh.

3. **Repo Renaming Adventures**: We pulled off a classic repo shuffle, renaming the ancient `website2` to `website2-archive` like it was a retired general, and then uploaded the new, shiny `website2` repo to GitHub like a phoenix rising from the ashes.

4. **Netlify Shuffle**: Time to delete the old Netlify setup. Why? Because we’re not just keeping things simple here. We nuked the old Netlify deployment and set up a fresh one with the codename `warm-crostata-e31905`—delicious and mysterious.

5. **NPMRC Shenanigans**: Enter the `.npmrc` problem—your work settings decided to sabotage the build, pulling packages from some cursed corporate registry like a rogue AI gone mad. This resulted in a critical failure mid-build, and frustration levels skyrocketed.

6. **Backup Your Backup’s Backup**: After a moment of controlled rage, we backed up the `.npmrc` file like responsible coders and restored the “normal” one from `npmrc-normal-bak`. Why do we have all these backups? Only the code gods know.

7. **The Great Cache Purge**: We hit `npm cache clean --force`, effectively giving npm the middle finger and telling it to start fresh, because if you're gonna fix npm problems, might as well go nuclear.

8. **"Where the Hell is my Repo?"**: After all this meticulous cleaning, you tried to `cd` into the wrong directory—because, of course, your local `website2` repo has decided to play hide-and-seek. A quick mental facepalm, and then back on track.

9. **Node Versioning Ritual**: We prayed to the version gods, invoking the `.nvmrc` file to ensure Node v20.16.0 is active, like a secret spell whispered in a forgotten tongue.

10. **Vanquishing Node Modules**: With a battle cry, we nuked `node_modules`, that bloated directory of dependency hell, followed by removing the ghost of a `yarn.lock` that apparently never existed, but we tried twice anyway just for good measure.

11. **Yarn Rebirth**: With our path cleared of wreckage, we summoned the powers of `yarn install` to begin the next chapter—installing fresh dependencies from the land of npmjs.org. Would it succeed? Only time (and another cup of coffee) would tell.
