## ðŸŒŸ Overview of the Week
- Summarize the general mood and key themes of the week here.

## ðŸ’» Projects Worked On

### GPT Glitch Tokens

I did another interview with Matthew Watkins, who has been doing fascinating research into glitch tokens.

I also started editing our interviews down, and thinking about how to narratively lay them out. I edited our initial 3 hour interview down about 50%, but that's still 90 minutes, and I haven't even gotten to our most recent interview which recaps his research over the year since our last interview.

## ðŸŽ¨ Creative Endeavors
