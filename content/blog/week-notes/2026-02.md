## What happened this week
What happened this week
Flew to Phoenix for the ASU journalism/AI conference. Gave a 5-minute Ignite talk about the Newswell newspaper automation work—terrified internally, but apparently didn’t show it. On the train down Monday, got an email with the obituary for David Chivers, the leader of the Lenfest group, who died by suicide on New Year’s Day. Spent the week at the conference he’d organized, without him. The engineering cohort doubled down on connecting and building trust in his memory. Also got the “your mortgage is approved” email mid-conference—rate locked, just waiting on final paperwork and a closing date. Very close but not real until it’s real.




## What I made / shipped


	∙	Delivered Ignite talk on AI newspaper automation and our “only replace the chores” philosophy—off the dome, no notes, maybe 7/10
	∙	First week with no GitHub commits in ages; laptop stayed closed the whole trip
	∙	Claude Code autonomous agents running in background spun out a constellation of OSINT monitoring sites: riverwatch, skywatch, camwatch, anomalywatch, and more at tools.ejfox.com
