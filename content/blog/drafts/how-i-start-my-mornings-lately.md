There are a few people who, when I watch their videos, fill me with motivation and inspiration.

When I wake up in the morning, pour my coffee, and sit on the porch, I usually want to have a video to watch to help get me in the mood, to help bridge the moment between waking and executing.

Hitomi, Adam Savage, or Van Neistat almost always put me in the right headspace.

Ideally it's creative people making things, or talking about making things, or talking about life in a way that gets me thinking.

I used to start the morning with comedy podcasts or the news and these essentially did the opposite of what I wanted; engrossing me and putting me in a specific mood instead of making space for me to zone in and out and think about what the person is saying and how I want to spend my day.
