There are a few people who, when I watch their videos, fill me with motivation and inspiration.

When I wake up in the morning, pour my coffee, and sit on the porch, I usually want to have a video to watch to help get me in the mood, to help bridge the moment between waking and executing.

Hitomi, Adam Savage, or Van Neistat almost always put me in the right headspace.
