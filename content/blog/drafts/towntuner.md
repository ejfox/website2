## TownTuner

### The Idea

A dedicated podcast player for all 360 episodes of Harmontown, designed specifically for nightly sleep listening with gamification elements.

### Outline

#### The problem
- Generic podcast apps aren't designed for sleep
- Harmontown has 360 episodes - a journey
- Falling asleep to podcasts is a specific use case
- "Would I use this at 2 AM with a cat on my chest?"

#### The Prestige System
- Complete all 360 episodes chronologically
- Episodes marked complete at 85% playback
- Completing all = 1 Prestige level
- Counter permanently displayed
- Episodes reset upon prestiging
- Gamification that respects the content

#### Sleep-First Design
- Thumb-first UI (right thumb reachable)
- Automatic fade-out sleep timer
- Designed for barely conscious operation
- Smart shuffle (only unplayed from current prestige)

#### Brutalist Glass Aesthetic
- iOS 18+ liquid glass effects
- Monochrome design
- Ultra-thin material backgrounds
- Spring physics animations (1.4s duration, 0.25 bounce)

#### Technical Details
- SwiftUI with iOS 18+ features
- AVFoundation for background playback
- CloudKit for cross-device sync
- Lock screen controls with custom artwork

#### Planned Features
- Vodka bottle clicker mini-game (credits screen)
- TownTuner Wrapped (annual stats)
- Guest search functionality
- Apple Watch companion
