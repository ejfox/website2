## THE IDEA

Most election visualizations optimize for the wrong moment—they're built for election night when they should be built for election week.

## THE BEATS

- What does "failure" mean for election viz? (not crashing ≠ success)
- The Steve Kornacki problem: TV needs different things than web
- Why county-level matters more than state-level
- The "calling races" trap—visualizing certainty we don't have
- Real-time data is a liability, not a feature
- What I learned building NBC's Big Board

## OUTLINE

### The night I watched our visualization lie

[Story from election night—the moment when real-time data created false narratives]

### Three failure modes

1. **Technical failure** (it crashes)—this is the easy one
2. **Narrative failure** (it tells the wrong story)—more common
3. **Trust failure** (it erodes confidence in the result)—the worst

### What actually works

- Design for uncertainty, not false precision
- County-level > state-level for storytelling
- Pre-compute everything you can
- Have a "chaos mode" ready

### The uncomfortable truth

Most newsrooms don't need real-time election visualization. They need a good static map and an editor who knows when to update it.

*Notes: Pull from NBC experience. Reference the Times quote about "juiced-up model." Be specific about what we did differently.*
