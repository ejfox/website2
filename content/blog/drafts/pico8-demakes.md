## PICO-8 Demakes

### The Idea

Small PICO-8 carts and experiments - taking game concepts and shrinking them down to 128x128 pixels and 8192 tokens.

### The Games

#### Christmas Demake
- Minimalist stop-timing train game
- A to depart, B to brake
- Nail the platform sweet spot
- Combos, streaks, turbo mode
- Ultimate rewards for precision

#### City Council
- Balance/grind-style minigame
- D-pad left/right to balance
- Survive the timer to win
- Jump unlocks at higher levels
- Council meeting as game mechanic

#### Signal Sprint
- Crossing-signal quickplay
- A toggles top signal
- B toggles left signal
- Prevent collisions as trains speed up
- Reaction time challenge

### Why PICO-8?

#### The Fantasy Console
- Fixed constraints (128x128, 16 colors, 8192 tokens)
- Built-in sprite/map/sound editors
- Shareable as tiny HTML or PNG

#### Constraints as Creativity
- Can't over-engineer when you have 8K tokens
- Every byte matters
- Forces clarity of design

#### The Demake Philosophy
- Take a big idea
- Strip it to the core mechanic
- What's the essence of the game?

### Technical Notes

- SFX/music authored in PICO-8 directly
- Lua with strict token limits
- 60fps gameplay in tiny footprint
