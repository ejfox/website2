## The Tom Sachs Hacker Dream Deferred
*[Expand on the aesthetic - Tom Sachs' plywood philosophy, Michael Reeves' unhinged robotics, the crossover mindset]*

## Space as Constraint

But I need a house. And a garage. For now I'm limited to the digital realm.

*[Write about the frustration of having hands that want to build but can only type. The constraint of apartment living. Dreams deferred by real estate prices.]*

## The Shopping List as Vision Board

*[Turn the tool list below into a meditation on dreaming of future making. Each tool represents a capability currently out of reach.]*

## What I'd Build First

*[Describe the project that's been haunting you. The first thing you'd make if you had space tomorrow.]*

## Minimum Viable Making

*[Explore what's the smallest possible start. What could fit in a corner? How do you begin when you can't really begin?]*

## Tool Inventory (The Dream List)

*Each tool represents a capability I can't access, a project I can't start, a skill I can't develop. But someday…*

### The Material Philosophy

**Plywood: The Universal Building Block**
- 7-ply, 3/4", AC Fir – 4ft x 8ft sheets (66lbs each)
- [Tom Sachs' love letter to plywood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVxldyIa0Bg) - treating construction materials like a programming language

**Standard Lumber** (Van Neistat's approach - work within constraints)
- 1x2, 1x4 pine boards
- 2x2, 2x4 framing lumber
- Learn the grammar of these dimensions before expanding

### Core Power Tools (~$800-1000)

**Cutting & Shaping**
- Jigsaw (DeWalt/Milwaukee, t-shank, barrel grip) - $200
  *The Swiss Army knife of cutting - curves, straight lines, detail work*
- Japanese pull saw - $40
  *Precision hand cutting, meditation through sawing*
- Orbital sander - $80

**Drilling & Driving**
- Milwaukee M12 cordless drill/driver - $150
  *The most-used tool in any shop*
- Impact driver - $120
  *For when screws need to go deep and stay put*

**Specialty**
- Dremel rotary tool - $170
  *Detail work, electronics integration, chaos engineering*

### Hand Tools & Precision (~$300)

**Measurement & Marking**
- Combination square with level (12") - $50
- Speed square - $25
- Tape measure (25ft) - $30
- Pencils, marking gauges, awl

**Fastening & Assembly**
- Phillips screwdrivers (#1, #2, #3)
- Needle nose pliers
- Vice grips
- Quick-release clamps (various sizes) - $100
- Wood screws assortment
- Pocket hole jig - $40

### Workshop Infrastructure (~$400)

**Workspace**
- Folding sawhorses (pair) - $80
- Work surface/bench top - $150
- LED work lights - $60
- Extension cords, power strips

**Safety & Finishing**
- Safety glasses, dust masks, hearing protection - $50
- Sandpaper assortment (80, 120, 220 grit)
- Tom Sachs color palette:
  - Matte white paint
  - Matte black paint
  - Glossy red paint
- Paint rollers, brushes, drop cloths

### The Electronics Integration Dream

*Where hacker meets maker*
- Arduino/Raspberry Pi integration
- LED strips and programmable lighting
- Sensors, servos, steppers
- 3D printed brackets and custom hardware
- Cable management and electronics enclosures

**Total Investment: ~$1,500-2,000**
*(Plus garage space: priceless)*
