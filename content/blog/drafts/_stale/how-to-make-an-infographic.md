## How to Actually Make an Infographic (Start with Data, Not Design)

"We should infographic this!"

"Okay, what data do you have?"

"Oh none… just, uh, some numbers I wrote on this napkin."

Are you kidding me?

This conversation happens more often than you'd think. Here's how to avoid being that person, and actually make infographics that work.

### Step 1: What Data Do We Actually Have?

This sounds simple but a lot of time people are like "We should infographic this?" "okay what data do you have?" "Oh none… just, uh, some numbers I wrote on this napkin" like are you kidding me? So make sure we have some data.

**My minimum thresholds:**
- 100 rows and we're talking
- Ideally 1000 rows
- Or a million - then we can do some really cool shit

But raw numbers aren't enough. We wanna get metadata: how many columns do we have? Are they numeric? Categorical? These will inform the types of visualizations that are possible.

### Step 2: Every Row is a Thing

I also always like to think of my data visualizations as 'things' - each row is a 'thing.' What is that 'thing'?

- Is it a measurement from a device?
- An entry a human filled out in a form?
- A transaction that happened?

These will inform how much you can trust it and how you will represent it to the user. Sensor data tells a different story than survey responses, even if they're measuring the same thing.

### Step 3: Find What's Actually Worth Showing

Most bad infographics try to show everything. Good ones show one insight clearly.

Before you start designing anything, ask:

- What's the most surprising thing in this data?
- What would change someone's mind?
- What story does this data definitively tell?

If you can't explain your main point in one sentence, you're not ready to make an infographic yet.

### Step 4: Pick the Right Visual (Not the Pretty One)

This isn't about what looks cool - it's about what actually works for your data:

- **Relationships:** Scatter plots, network diagrams
- **Change over time:** Line charts, small multiples
- **Comparing quantities:** Bar charts, dot plots
- **Parts of a whole:** Treemaps, stacked bars
- **Never pie charts** (seriously, just don't)

### The Real Point

Most good infographics are just good journalism. They answer a question people actually have using data people can trust. The visual design matters, but getting the data foundation right matters more.
