## Making Seitan 

I make seitan sometimes. It's wheat gluten - the stretchy protein part of flour - cooked into something vaguely meat-like.

### How to Make It

Mix vital wheat gluten with water and whatever seasonings you want. Knead it until stretchy. Wrap in foil, steam for an hour. That's it.

### Things I've Noticed

Don't overknead it or it gets rubbery. Wheat gluten is pretty bland so you need more seasoning than you think. Soy sauce, garlic powder, nutritional yeast work well.

### Why Bother

It's cheaper than the store-bought stuff and I know what's in it. Takes about an hour but most of that is just waiting for it to steam.

It doesn't taste like chicken or whatever. It's just chewy protein that picks up whatever flavors you add to it.
