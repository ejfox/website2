## Pandemic Soap-Making with Mom

*We spent the pandemic making soap together. It taught me about physical making, always having a gift to give someone, and the strange alchemy of scent.*

## The Lockdown Laboratory

*[Write about how soap-making became your pandemic project - something creative and purposeful to do together when the world felt crazy]*

## Scent Mixology

*[Explore the art of blending fragrances - developing your perfumer's nose, learning how different oils interact, creating signature scent combinations]*

## Real Chemistry, Real Consequences

*[Compare working with lye (actually dangerous!) to digital work - no undo button, timing critical, physical reactions happening. The satisfaction of mastering something with real stakes]*

## The Gift Economy

*[Write about building a stockpile of handmade soap as your go-to present - always having something meaningful to give, the joy of gifting utility that's also beautiful]*

## What Physical Making Teaches

*[Reflect on lessons learned: precision, patience, working with materials that have their own properties, the difference between digital and analog creation]*

## Why We Stopped (And Maybe Should Start Again)

*[Explore why the soap-making ended - pandemic over, life moved on? What would it mean to pick it back up now?]*

## The Original Process Notes

### Choosing Colors

The first step in our soap-making adventure is selecting the colors that will bring our creations to life. We like to choose colors that complement each other and reflect the scent or theme of the soap. You can use natural colorants like clays and botanicals or synthetic colorants like micas and pigments.

### Choosing Scents

Next, we decide on the fragrance for our soap. This can be achieved using essential oils for a natural scent or fragrance oils for a wider range of options. We love experimenting with different combinations to create unique and delightful scents.

### Weighing Ingredients

Accuracy is key when it comes to measuring out the ingredients for our soap. We carefully weigh all oils, lye, and water using a digital scale to ensure the correct proportions for a successful batch.

### Melting Oils

Once we have our ingredients measured out, we gently heat the oils in a double boiler until they are fully melted and combined. It's essential to monitor the temperature during this process to prevent overheating.

### Lye + Mineral Water Reaction

Safety comes first when working with lye. Wearing gloves and goggles, we slowly add lye to cold mineral water (never reverse this order) while stirring. This creates a chemical reaction that heats the water and releases fumes, so it's important to do this in a well-ventilated area.

#### Using Lye and Tea-Brewed Water

For a unique twist, we sometimes replace mineral water with tea-brewed water to add an extra layer of fragrance and color to our soap.

### Pouring Techniques

Once our oils and lye solution have cooled to the appropriate temperature, we combine them and blend until we reach "trace"—the point at which the mixture thickens slightly. Now comes the fun part: pouring our soap into molds! We use various pouring techniques, such as layers, swirls, or embeds, to create visually stunning designs.

Conclusion:

Making soap with my mom has been a rewarding experience that not only allows us to bond but also results in beautiful, fragrant creations we can share with friends and family. By following these steps and experimenting with colors, scents, and pouring techniques, you too can embark on your own soap-making journey and create lasting memories with your loved ones.
