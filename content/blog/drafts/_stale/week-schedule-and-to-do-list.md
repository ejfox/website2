## How I Schedule My Week

[i-just-do-what-my-calendar-say](i-just-do-what-my-calendar-say)s]]

I put everything in my calendar and then just do what it says. Not because I'm super organized, but because my brain doesn't work well with abstract "I should do this sometime" tasks.

### The System

**Calendar gets everything**: Work meetings, personal appointments, time blocks for projects, even "answer emails for 30 minutes." If it's not scheduled, it doesn't happen.

**No task apps**: Tried them all, they become digital clutter. Calendar forces me to commit to when things actually happen.

**Time blocking**: Big projects get chopped into 2-3 hour calendar blocks. "Work on website" is useless. "Fix photo upload bug" from 2-4pm Tuesday works.

### What Actually Happens

I schedule too much, always. Wednesday looks reasonable on Sunday, insane by Tuesday.

I move things around constantly. The schedule is a starting point, not a contract.

Some weeks I follow it religiously and get tons done. Other weeks it falls apart by Monday afternoon and I wing it.

### Why It Works (When It Works)

ADHD brain needs external structure. Calendar provides that without requiring me to remember what I'm supposed to be doing.

When someone asks "can you meet Thursday at 3?" I can look at my calendar and actually know if I'm free instead of guessing.

Forces me to estimate how long things actually take, which I'm terrible at but slowly getting better.

### The Real Secret

I send calendar invites for everything, even to myself. Makes it feel more real than just typing it in a text field somewhere.
