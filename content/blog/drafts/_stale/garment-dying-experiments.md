## Garment Dyeing Experiments

Started with classic tie dye but moved toward more subtle approaches. One or two colors max, focusing on getting interesting effects rather than rainbow chaos.

### Evolution of Techniques

**Early Phase: Classic Tie Dye**
Basic rubber band patterns, multiple colors. Looked like every other tie dye shirt. Got boring fast.

**Deep Black Ice Dyeing**
Started using massive amounts of black powder dye with slow ice melting. The heavy concentration creates these intense blacks that dilute into deep blues and purples as the ice spreads it around. Takes forever but the color depth is incredible.

**Aluminum Foil Ice Dyeing**
Game changer. Wrap sections in foil before adding ice and dye. Creates these sharp geometric patterns - very cyberpunk, almost digital looking. The foil blocks create clean edges while the ice creates organic spreads in the open areas.

**Thrift Store Print Overdyeing** 
Friends discovered this - take printed shirts from thrift stores and dye over them. The original print shows through in weird ways. Turns corporate logos into abstract art. Works especially well with light prints under dark dyes.

### What Actually Works

**Single color focus**: Better to nail one color than muddy up multiple
**Heavy dye concentration**: Don't be stingy with the powder
**Slow process**: Good ice dyeing can't be rushed
**Cotton works best**: Synthetic blends don't take dye evenly
**Salt helps**: Keeps colors from bleeding together

### Surprises

Black dye isn't really black - it's a mix that separates into blues, purples, sometimes greens when diluted. The aluminum foil technique creates patterns I couldn't design intentionally. Overdyeing printed shirts creates effects that look almost screen-printed.

The best results come from combining control (foil placement, dye concentration) with randomness (ice melting patterns, dye flow).
