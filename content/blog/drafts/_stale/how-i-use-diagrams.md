## How I Use Diagrams to Think

I diagram everything - not for other people, but to externalize the complexity bouncing around in my head. Drawing the problem is often faster than thinking through the problem.

Meeting notes become network maps. Project planning becomes flowcharts. Debugging becomes visual data flow traces. These aren't for presentation - they're thinking tools.

### Real-Time System Capture

I use Scapple to draw systems as people describe them. Instead of linear notes, I capture nodes, connections, data flows. Then I show it back - they see their system externalized and immediately start correcting it.

This catches misunderstandings during conversation instead of weeks later during implementation.

### Tools for Thinking

**Pen & Paper**: Fastest brain-to-external interface. Zero learning curve, no crashes.

**Scapple**: Infinite canvas, no forced structure. Fast enough for real-time conversation. Drop ideas anywhere, connect as relationships become clear.

**Mermaid**: Text-based diagrams. Good when you know the structure but don't want to fight drag-and-drop.

Use the messiest tool that still helps you think. Clean diagrams are for communication, messy ones are for understanding.

### Visual to Structured

Once you've diagrammed a system, you can extract structured data from it:

- Network maps → CSV of relationships and communication patterns
- Dependency flowcharts → Task lists with proper sequencing  
- Architecture sketches → Database schemas and API specs

Diagrams bridge messy human thinking and structured machine-readable data. Visual thinking understands the problem space, formal representations feed software systems.
