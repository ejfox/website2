## Network visualizations made easy: introducing connectology

#network

I've been doing a lot of work exploring networks lately, and I commonly want an easy way to take a list of nodes/edges and share them. It felt like there was space for a performant and visualization-minded approach to a frontend, so I set to work.

I finally have a version with all the basic functionality I have been wanting:

- Super easy to add nodes and links
- Full control over force layout settings
- Public shareable URLs of networks
- AI enhancement features to generate more connections, add nodes, and label networks in one-click
- Basic import functionality; import from CSV, or use an LLM to convert text into a network graph automatically

I have been using this tool myself to explore different topic areas, and I am excited to continue building it as a tool that directly helps me and my friends (you guys!) make more, better work, and uncover and illustrate the hidden connections the world is filled with.

I would love your thoughts/feedback on the tool, and please let me know if you encounter any bugs or rough corners. Appreciate it!
