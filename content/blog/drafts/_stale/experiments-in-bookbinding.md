## Bookbinding Attempts

I've been trying to bind my own books. Mostly because I want notebooks that are exactly the right size and paper type, and store-bought ones are never quite right.

### What I've Tried

**Saddle stitch**: Fold paper in half, stab holes through the middle, sew with thread. Works for thin books. Easy but limited.

**Japanese stab binding**: Stack paper, poke holes along one edge, thread in a pattern. Looks nice but pages don't lay flat.

**Coptic stitch**: Multiple signatures sewn together with exposed binding. Strongest but takes forever to do right.

### Materials

Most bookbinding tutorials assume you have a bunch of specialized tools. You don't really need them for simple stuff:

- **Paper**: Whatever you want to write on. I use mixed media paper usually.
- **Thread**: Bookbinding thread is nice but dental floss works too.
- **Needle**: Any sturdy needle. Bookbinding needles are blunt which helps.
- **Awl**: For making holes. You can use a thick needle or even a small screwdriver.

### What Works

Simple saddle stitch notebooks are actually pretty good for most things. 8-10 sheets of paper folded in half gives you a decent pocket notebook.

The key is getting the holes straight and evenly spaced. Mark them with a ruler before you punch.

### What Doesn't

Trying to bind thick books without a proper press is frustrating. The pages won't stay aligned and everything shifts around while you're sewing.

Fancy decorative papers look nice but they're usually too thin or don't fold well.

### Why I Keep Doing It

Store notebooks never have the right paper weight or ruling. Plus there's something nice about using a book you made yourself, even if it's a bit wonky.

Takes maybe an hour to make a simple notebook. Not fast, but not terrible either.
