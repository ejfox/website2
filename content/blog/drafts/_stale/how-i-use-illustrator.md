## How Illustrator Accidentally Launched My Career

In 2008, I made an infographic about religious teachings on sexuality. It was practice—maybe my first or second attempt at data visualization. I posted it on Flickr, went to bed, and woke up to a different life.

[The infographic](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pseudoplacebo/2330148551) got 362,395 views. People were sharing it, discussing it, critiquing the data sources (correctly). I had to add an update admitting "this source sucks" and asking for better citations.

But the damage was done. That one Illustrator file, created as a learning exercise, opened doors I didn't know existed. Freelance opportunities. Job interviews. A whole career path I'd never considered.

## The Tool That Teaches You to Think Visually

What I love about Illustrator is how it forces you to think about information architecturally. You can't just dump data into a template—you have to understand relationships, hierarchies, visual flow. Every chart is a small exercise in information design.

The pen tool teaches patience. Bezier curves teach precision. Layer organization teaches systems thinking. It's not just design software—it's visual problem-solving training.

## SVG: The Most Magical Format in Computing

Here's what makes SVG special: it's both graphical art AND readable code. An LLM can parse it. A browser can render it. You can edit it by hand in a text editor. It's one of the few formats that bridges human visual expression and machine understanding.

When I export an infographic from Illustrator as SVG, I'm not just creating a graphic—I'm creating a structured document that computers can understand. Every element has meaning, relationships, metadata. It's data visualization that's literally made of data.

## Why This Still Matters

Adobe's corporate bullshit aside, Illustrator remains one of the best tools for thinking visually about complex information. Not because it's the only option, but because it gets out of your way once you learn it.

That 2008 religious sexuality chart was crude by today's standards. The data was questionable. The design was basic. But it taught me something crucial: sometimes a simple visualization of complex information can spark conversations that matter.

Sixteen years later, I'm still using the same tool, still trying to make information more accessible, still occasionally admitting when my sources suck.
