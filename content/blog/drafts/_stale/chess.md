## I am really bad at chess

I've played chess my entire life and hover around 1200 rating on chess.com. 

### Different Types of Learning

Chess doesn't respond to the same learning methods that work for other technical skills:

**HAM radio licensing**: Memorize frequency allocations and power limits. Study → pass test.

**LeetCode problems**: Recognize algorithm patterns. Practice → recognize → solve.

**Chess**: Develop board vision and tactical pattern recognition. Study → still lose.

The feedback loops are different. HAM and LeetCode give clear progress signals. Chess improvement is so incremental that months of study can feel like no improvement at all.

### Data Analysis Paradox

Chess.com's API provides detailed game analysis: opening repertoire, blunder rates, time usage patterns, accuracy percentages by opening type. You can analyze every mistake, see engine evaluations, understand exactly what you should have done.

But the gap between analysis and application is massive. I can review a game, understand why Nf6 was better than Nf3, then play Nf3 again in the next similar position.

Chess gives you more detailed feedback on failure than almost any other activity, but that feedback doesn't translate to better play the way it would in other domains.
