## A Hacker's Guide to the I Ching

_Why did the inventor of binary code and the founder of analytical psychology both become obsessed with a 3,000-year-old Chinese fortune-telling book?_

### The First Binary Computer

Gottfried Leibniz discovered the I Ching in 1701 and immediately recognized something profound: the 64 hexagrams perfectly mapped onto his newly invented binary number system. Each broken line (yin) was 0, each solid line (yang) was 1.

_[Explore Leibniz's excitement at finding binary in ancient Chinese wisdom - the mathematical foundation of all computing embedded in divination]_

### Randomness as Intelligence

Modern machine learning depends on stochasticity - controlled randomness that creates emergent intelligence. The I Ching operates the same way: random coin tosses or yarrow stalks generate patterns that somehow produce meaningful insights.

_[Connect AI training methods to I Ching consultation methods - both use randomness to explore possibility space]_

### Jung's Synchronicity Hypothesis

Carl Jung saw the I Ching as proof that meaningful coincidences exist - that the universe has an acausal connecting principle. He spent decades using it for decision-making and patient therapy.

_[Explore Jung's idea that the moment of consultation connects to the nature of the question - like quantum measurement affecting outcomes]_

### The System that Programs You

Unlike other divination systems, the I Ching doesn't predict the future - it maps the present moment's potential for change. Each hexagram is a snapshot of a dynamic system in flux.

_[Connect to systems thinking, state machines, and how hackers think about system states and transitions]_

### Why Hackers Need Ancient Wisdom

In a world of algorithmic decision-making, the I Ching offers something different: a framework for navigating uncertainty without trying to eliminate it. It teaches you to work with randomness instead of against it.
