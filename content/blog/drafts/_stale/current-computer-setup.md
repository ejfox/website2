## Current Computer Setup

### Hardware

**M1 MacBook Pro 14"**: Fast, quiet, good battery. Does everything I need without thermal throttling or fan noise.

**External Monitor**: 27" 4K. More screen space for code, data, multiple browser tabs.

**Keyboard/Mouse**: Whatever's around. Not picky about input devices.

### Software

**Terminal**: iTerm2 with oh-my-zsh. Customized for git status, directory navigation.

**Code**: VS Code. Extensions for Vue, Python, markdown. Auto-save enabled.

**Browser**: Firefox. Chrome for testing. Safari for media consumption.

**Notes**: Obsidian for long-form thinking. Apple Notes for quick capture.

**Design**: Figma for UI, Sketch for icons, Photoshop for photo editing.

**Data**: Python with pandas, Observable for prototyping, D3 for web viz.

### Workflow

Most work happens in terminal and browser. Terminal for git, file management, running scripts. Browser for testing, debugging, research.

I keep multiple projects open in different VS Code windows. Switch between them with Cmd+Tab.

Screenshots go to desktop, get processed later. Downloads folder gets cleaned weekly.

### What Works

Minimal setup means fewer things to break. Standard tools mean easier collaboration with others.

Auto-sync keeps everything backed up. Can lose the laptop and be working again within hours on a new machine.

### What Doesn't

Still too many browser tabs open. Still accumulate screenshots I never organize. Still forget to clean up temp files.

The setup is fine. The habits need work.
