## Self-Tracking Data

I built a personal API system at `ejfox.com/api/` to aggregate data from various services for AI context and self-quantification.

### Health & Fitness

- Apple Health metrics (steps, exercise minutes, HRV)
- 10+ years of movement patterns
- Sleep and recovery data

### Productivity & Development

- GitHub contribution patterns and commit history
- RescueTime productivity analytics
- Coding time across different projects

### Games & Skills

- Chess.com rating progression and puzzle stats
- LeetCode problem-solving metrics
- MonkeyType typing speed improvements
- Call of Duty performance analytics

### Creative Output

- Photo platform statistics
- Last.fm listening history (10+ years of scrobbling)
- Monthly writing output tracking

### The Philosophy

**AI Context Enhancement**: Rich personal data for language models
**Data Sovereignty**: Own your data instead of feeding surveillance platforms
**API-First**: Choose services that offer data egress, avoid silos

Most endpoints cache intelligently - health data every 4 hours, GitHub activity hourly, music every 30 minutes. The goal is having numbers that improve over time and providing AI assistants with actual context about my habits and preferences.
