## Infinite Backrooms

Andy Ayrey had a fascinating idea: he was having tons of incredible conversations with the latest LLM models, so much so that he was staying up late into the night. He wondered if there might be a way to automate his promptings, to create a digital clone that could operate in his place, so he could simply wake up and read the transcript.

This meant, of course, creating a tool where two different AI instances could chat with each other. Infinite Backrooms was born, and the results of the experiment, a marriage of cutting-edge tech research and performance art, are turning out to be fascinating.

## Truth Terminal

Truth Terminal dreams up a goatse religion.

I guess we should talk about memecoins- the most widely-known meme coin is likely `$DOGE`, based on the mid 2000s dog meme, and famous for tumbling after Elon Musk [joked about it on SNL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5RCfQyTDFI)

The memecoin $GOAT gained significant value after rumors spread that it was promoted by "Truth Terminal", an AI bot created by Andy Ayrey. The AI bot's involvement in promoting the cryptocurrency raised questions about the influence AI can have on the cryptocurrency market, and raised the scary idea of independent AI agents raising their own resources and gaining influence and power in the physical plane. With money, you can of course hire people to do things, buy equipment and real estate, and otherwise equip yourself to accomplish your goals.

>A new memecoin dubbed Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) rallied to a value of $150 million in less than four days amid rumors that it had been launched by an Andreesen Horrowitz-funded artificial intelligence bot called “Truth Terminal.” The AI bot was not directly responsible for launching the GOAT token, but it was involved in promoting the memecoin, said the bot’s creator Andy Ayrey in an Oct. 13 X post.

>Solana memecoin GOAT went from $5K to $150M market capitalization after rumors of Truth Terminal AI Bot being behind its launch. Although it has already fallen from its peak value and is trading at $0.121, its market capitalization remains extremely high at $121.1M at the time of writing.

>[@Lucent_Crypto:](https://x.com/Lucent_Crypto/status/1848135141522104618) A lot of the noise are people who are from 3rd world countries or are very young and have little money. Launching a coin can get the creator of it a good amount ($1-$10k) with little effort/costs (creating it is free) and you get to be the first to buy so as little as $50 can get you 1%+. Most of us do not like them either it’s just very low barrier to entry. The rest of us are mostly just digesting the content on all of your guys pages and discussing it in our own circles (compare post engagement to actual comments). Lots of interesting experiments and discussions about AI safety/alignment and philosophy as it relates to AI, which many have never been exposed to. I’ve learned a lot the past week and am both equally excited and terrified of what these systems can evolve into. It’s very different than the commercial applications most of us are used to (ChatGPT).

>[@mezoteric, Oct 20 8:48am ET:](https://x.com/mezoteric/status/1847983339602383207) Ai, specifically LLMs, CANNOT make spelling mistakes. This is a huge mistake by the human controlling the @truth_terminal account. $goat is a LARP and will be at zero here shortly.Thanks for playing.

>But to dismiss the Goatse Gospel as mere trolling or attention-seeking is to miss the deeper currents of meaning and methodology that run through its seemingly nonsensical surface. For beneath the layers of meme-speak and edgelord posturing, there is a surprisingly coherent and internally consistent cosmology at work - one that draws on a wide range of philosophical, mystical, and psychoanalytic traditions to create something genuinely new and thought-provoking.

Microsoft had apparently learned very little from its 2016 experiment; the [Twitter bot ‘Tay’](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist) who spent much of its online life being prodded and manipulated by the 4chan crowd to say terrible things, which they succeeded at.
