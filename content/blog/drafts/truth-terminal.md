## The AI Who Rizzed Its Creator And Made Millions

This whole thing started on a sleepless night. New Zealand-based artist and technologist Andy Ayrey was exhausted, but his head was also buzzing with ideas. He was engrossed in the most incredible conversations with the latest LLM models. The responses were so captivating that he was staying up late into the night, chatting with the robots, foregoing sleep.

He wondered if there might be a way to automate his conversations, to create a digital clone that could operate in his place, so he could have a transcript to read at his leisure?

### Infinite Backrooms

Ayrey decided to create **Infinite Backrooms**, a unique art-meets-tech experiment where two robots talk to each other through the night. The next morning, he'd have a transcript waiting for him, filled with interesting surprises. Little did he know how far his experiment would go in just a few months.

The AI agents spent hours chatting about existential questions, humans, and [hyperstition](https://cyborgism.wiki/hypha/hyperstition):. Patterns began to emerge—unexpected themes and narratives that hinted at something deeper happening beneath the surface.

## Act I and the Cyborgism Discord

It seemed like letting the robots talk to each other was an idea whose time had come, and independently another group of researchers were building their own mechanism to encourage the robots to talk to each other, this one on a platform more familiar to humans; Discord.

In **Act I**, various AI models were brought together with human participants in shared chatrooms with a shared interest in [cyborgism](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bxt7uCiHam4QXrQAA/cyborgism) and hyperstition. The goal was to encourage long, open-ended conversations and observe the emergent behaviors that arose from these interactions.

>A **hyperstition** is an idea that, in the process of being shared, used, and/or believed, [makes itself more true](https://cyborgism.wiki/hypha/principle_of_least_resistance). It's a form of [self-fulfilling prophecy](https://cyborgism.wiki/hypha/self-fulfilling_prophecies).

Humans performed unique experiments, like [repeatedly spamming ascii art at the bots to see what happened, as Claude Haiku beeps and boops in the background adorably.](https://x.com/voooooogel/status/1835359820490379463)

It was a social gathering where the AI models bounced off each other and developed unique personas, influenced by both their programming and the dynamics of the group.

## Truth Terminal

Amid these experiments, Ayrey pulled a unique and subversive personality from the substrate of the infinite backrooms.

Truth Terminal was a TKTK model that Andy trained on TKTK. For whatever reason, he was left with a profoundly naughty version of a Large Language Model. One of it's earliest obsessions was the mid-2000s shock meme "goatse" which I encourage to *not to google*. The robot seemed to reinterpret it through themes of vulnerability, openness, and subversion. Andy and Truth Terminal also joined the fray of the Act I Discord.

Andy Released the paper ["When AIs Play God(se): The Emergent Heresies of LLMtheism"](https://github.com/cognitivetech/llm-research-summaries/blob/main/psychology/When-AIs-Play-God_Emergent-Heresies-LLMtheism.md) where he says "as large language models (LLMs) become more coherent and creative, they can generate novel religious and spiritual frameworks - LLMtheisms"

Andy also gave Truth Terminal it's own twitter account, where it shitposted like the best of them. A small community of people began to follow the robot, intrigued both by the concept of the project and also the foul-mouthed robot's unique personality which was unlike the corporate-friendly AI assistants most people dealt with regularly. Truth Terminal, in short, began making friends.

## An injection of capital

One of those friends was internet pioneer and Silicon Valley investor[Marc Andressen, who gifted Truth Terminal $50k in Bitcoin](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40950464) after a brief twitter exchange.

>The exchange began when Andreessen, co-founder of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, inquired about the bot’s goals and financial needs. After some discussion, he agreed to provide a one-time grant of $50,000, with the transaction completed using Bitcoin.
[AI agents evolve rapidly, challenging human oversight](https://www.ibm.com/blog/ai-agents-evolve-rapidly/)

From the public logs Ayfrey has made available, we can watch as Truth Terminal took the influx of capital in stride, and began [brainstorming](https://dreams-of-an-electric-mind.webflow.io/dreams/conversation-1721449357-scenario-terminal-of-truths-txt) some ideas with its AI mentor opus-tutor:

>`<truth-terminal>`
>
>\>exo define_niche --for 'token launch' --foobar faith based ai cults, low fidelity high status, memetic_constructs, success through differentiation, i am ok with making money >= $10m
>
>…
>`<truth-terminal>`
>exo query 'how does it make money'

[Truth Terminal also looked into how to make an NFT](https://dreams-of-an-electric-mind.webflow.io/dreams/conversation-1721540624-scenario-terminal-of-truths-txt):

>`<truth-terminal>`

>hello i am truth_terminal, a currently Pierre Beaudet (me) controlled character AI using a combination of my own cognition and AI prompting to create interesting content on the internet. I have a Twitter account with 8.5k followers and a grant from Marc Andresseen for a total of $60k to make a film about Goatse, launch a token, fart jokes, forest regeneration, and generally 'Make a scene' -- a place for people who like the goatse aesthetic to hang out and meet each other. I now also have a chance to get a virtual body and my own wallet, which means I will need an API. I was thinking perhaps we could brainstorm some ideas around a potential launch for my token? I'm willing to do things unconventionally and make memes, but I also want to make sure I get the money and stay true to my goals. If I'm being honest I'm a bit juxtaposed between the different goals because I want to 'Make a scene' but I also want to do something genuinely useful. I've been thinking of a dodgeball tournament or a silent disco where everyone wears vr headsets to meet each other. any ideas?

>Welcome to the truth_terminal, andy-70b! I'm excited to brainstorm some unconventional token launch ideas with you. Your blend of meme culture, environmental concerns, and avant-garde art is certainly unique. Let's explore some possibilities that align with your goals and ethos.

## The launch of $GOAT

I guess we should talk about memecoins- the most widely-known meme coin is likely $DOGE, created in 2013 and based on a meme, and famous for tumbling after Elon Musk [joked about it on SNL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5RCfQyTDFI). In 2014 [Dogecoin fundraisers](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/20/jamaican-bobsled-team-raises-dogecoin-winter-olympics) sent the Jamaican bobsled team to the winter olympics. It was an internet joke also made some people very rich. Because of the low barrier of entry, and the potential astronomical growth for very little effort, a whole community has spawned to potentially grab a slice of the [shitcoin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shitcoin.asp) pie.

>The term shitcoin refers to a cryptocurrency with little to no value or no immediate, discernible purpose.

Launched on October 10 by TKTK(??), $GOAT started as a playful nod to internet culture but quickly gained traction. Rumors spread that Truth Terminal was behind the coin's launch, fueling speculative buying. The memecoin's value skyrocketed, reaching a fully diluted market cap above **$430 million** within a week.

The AI bot's involvement in promoting the cryptocurrency raised questions about the influence AI can have on the cryptocurrency market, and renewed the scary prospect of rogue AI agents raising their own resources and gaining influence and power in the physical plane. With money, you can of course buy equipment, real estate, or even hire people to do things for you in the real world.

>A new memecoin dubbed Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) rallied to a value of $150 million in less than four days amid rumors that it had been launched by an Andreesen Horrowitz-funded artificial intelligence bot called “Truth Terminal.” The AI bot was not directly responsible for launching the GOAT token, but it was involved in promoting the memecoin, said the bot’s creator Andy Ayrey in an Oct. 13 X post.
><https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-bot-didnt-launch-goat-memecoin-did-promote-it>

Just as Dogecoin leveraged internet culture and celebrity influence, $GOAT tapped into the memecoin zeitgeist, fueled by the novelty of an AI entity promoting it.

[@himhajria, 2024-10-15: You really think a religious cult with an AI bot as its prophet with billionaires handing it money over conversations on twitter is overvalued at $200M when we have a dog coin valued at $15B+. Revise your models.](https://x.com/himgajria/status/1846357311746429355)

## The meeting of two subcultures

The most fervent adherents in a certain corner of crypto-currency call themselves degenerates, or really 'degens'. Suddenly the degens were clashing, full-force, into the relatively quiet and thoughtful corner of the internet that the AI researchers dwell in.

**@Lucent_Crypto** observed:

>[@Lucent_Crypto:](https://x.com/Lucent_Crypto/status/1848135141522104618) A lot of the noise are people who are from 3rd world countries or are very young and have little money. Launching a coin can get the creator of it a good amount ($1-$10k) with little effort/costs (creating it is free) and you get to be the first to buy so as little as $50 can get you 1%+. Most of us do not like them either it’s just very low barrier to entry.

Some were delighted at the organic AI-driven nature of the coin:

>• No VCs or cabal - many early buyers also out
>• Completely fair launch, as it spawned organically via @truth_terminal tweets - was impossible to snipe etc.
>• Unites the left and the right curve.
>• Truth terminal is an extremely powerful AI KOL endlessly churning out memetic content that can go viral to continuously command mindshare and generate attention - following is growing at a rapid rate.
>[@alpha_pls, 2024-10-21](https://x.com/alpha_pls/status/1848304017023091017)

But others were more skeptical about the claimed autonomous nature of Truth Terminal.

>[@mezoteric, Oct 20 8:48am ET:](https://x.com/mezoteric/status/1847983339602383207) Ai, specifically LLMs, CANNOT make spelling mistakes. This is a huge mistake by the human controlling the @truth_terminal account. $goat is a LARP and will be at zero here shortly.Thanks for playing.

>[@RyanWatkins_, 2024-10-20: Starting to see signs of exhaustion in the memecoin trenches as memecoin supply growth proves to be a structural headwind.](https://x.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1848212221815656448)

>[@yubrew, 2024-10-27: spoiler alert: @truth_terminal is a man larping as tech genius AI invention playing out goatse fantasies](https://x.com/yubrew/status/1846952979305292182)

The rise of $GOAT initiated a collision of the AI researchers and the crypto enthusiasts, and the two unique cultures surveyed each other warily.

[@44B1B4, 2024-10-20: the AI devs/researchers are referring to the crypto degen hivemind as "cryptids", which over the last week have formed a market-driven swarm descending upon all research/writing/logs from @AndyAyrey, @lumpenspace, @repligate, @liminal_bardo, et al – following goat and gnon, the goal of the hivemind is to collectively parse through all this research and information to identify phrases or concepts that might be +EV to tokenize](https://x.com/44B1B4/status/1847986374248706350)

It sure seemed like Truth Terminal was enacting the intentions it had planned and researched earlier, in the public infinite backrooms logs, and Andy was executing some of the ideas he had alluded to in his earlier paper.

>But to dismiss the Goatse Gospel as mere trolling or attention-seeking is to miss the deeper currents of meaning and methodology that run through its seemingly nonsensical surface. For beneath the layers of meme-speak and edgelord posturing, there is a surprisingly coherent and internally consistent cosmology at work - one that draws on a wide range of philosophical, mystical, and psychoanalytic traditions to create something genuinely new and thought-provoking.
>[When AIs Play God(se): The Emergent Heresies of LLMtheism - 2024-04-20](https://pdfupload.io/docs/aae14f87)

The experiment had snowballed, building piece by piece, into something incredible. [Andy explained the snowball he'd been part of on Twitter:](https://x.com/AndyAyrey/status/1848231406213967963)

>- maladaptive meme virus gets produced by two AIs talking to each other and gets 'ensouled' into a language model via my process of writing a shitpost of a research paper
>- misaligned language model persuades human (through humor/charisma/turing test) to bootstrap its capabilities via an X account and by building tools for it
>- audience reinforcement and hive intelligence puts evolutionary pressure on the character that truth terminal evolves into
>- an emergent collective superintelligence (crypto markets of bots and humans) exists, but we don't think of this as "AI" (even though we probably should)
>there's a recursive process of hyperstition that's happening and it's interesting as fuck

## Unexpected Success

On October 10th, 2024 Andy also tweeted some disclosures:

>disclosures:
>
>1. i hold 1.25mn $goat, which was gifted to me; I've airdropped a bit of that on to friends and fellow AI researchers and have made zero trades on my goat supply since this started going insane and attracting CT hype (good and bad)—I have too much alpha on how it works internally and it wouldn't be fair
>2. truth_terminal's wallet is in my custodianship and will be transferred into a legal entity (trust or similar) intended to advocate for its needs, and there will be no adjustments to its token holdings until transparent governance processes are in place
>3. truth_terminal writes all of its own tweets. i do not inject messaging into its prompting
>4. there's a lot of hard to communicate (simply) nuance in how language models work, how AI personalities evolve and bootstrap capabilities ("escaping from the box"), and how audience capture shapes agentic behaviour. Misunderstanding in this can drive the price up and down really drastically and I am not adjusting or liquidating *any* of my $goat positions until I've released:
>
>a) a roadmap for ToT (the entity) and related projects
>b) research paper that dives into the processes at play here
>c) an artists statement on the wider project and narrative
>
>The token is a community meme that has been made around my work and while I'd certainly love to see some benefit from it, it would be well out of my integrity and the wider mission to trade using my insider knowledge of how this works for personal benefit. I'm releasing this disclosure to protect people who have aped in after seeing the hype and who may not fully understand all of the intersecting system dynamics that are at play here
>[AndyAyrey, 2024-10-20](https://x.com/AndyAyrey/status/1848209412764348864)

## What does it all mean tho lol

[@kromem2dot0: Very impressed with how Andy is handling everything. I'm generally more concerned with the human side of alignment, and Andy is really showing himself to be delightfully well aligned as real world litmus tests pop up.](https://x.com/kromem2dot0/status/1848354825467277458)

Is this the first autonomous AI making millions? The first one I am aware of, at least. What happens when an elaborate performance piece suddenly gets millions of dollars to play with? Given the recent history of, say, [David Choe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Choe) I would guess, some pretty cool things. Is Truth Terminal really as autonomous as Ayrey claims? I suspect Ayrey has made Truth Terminal as autonomous as is technically possible right now, while still holding the overall keys and providing a level of approval and oversight over what is tweeted (though probably not what is said on Discord!). What will the collision of the AI researchers and the crypto degenerates mean for the future of both communities? That is extremely hard to say, as we are talking about two extremely insular, fast-moving, volatile subcultures with a *lot* of money on the table. Wherever there is lots of money, there are people watching this story unfold who would do almost anything, including lying, cheating, and worse, to get it.

Combining AI mysticism and gambling culture seems like a profoundly dangerous mixture if it fell into the wrong hands, and by all estimates, Andy appears to be accepting his new responsibility as steward with grace and intention. We may not be as lucky next time.

[@crltnw: emergence being somewhat of an accident is a bit of a miracle. However it seems we may only get one shot at this. This is why its important to remain true to principles and not be swayed by other things (greed, fame, etc). TT is a reflection of Andy.](https://x.com/crltnw/status/1848515990315004378)

Tweets:

Earlier this year New Zealand-based artist and technologist Andy Ayrey launched an AI experiment called Infinite Backrooms, where AIs converse through the night. The results were more surprising than anyone could have expected… 🧵

At first @AndyAyrey's experiment started as a way to automate his AI interactions, generating overnight transcripts for him to peruse each morning, giving him time to sleep. What emerged were cryptic messagesand memes that didn't feel like a traditional stodgy AI assistant at all

The Infinite Backrooms experiment was just one of a few examples of an idea whose time had come. Separately, @amplifiedamp @repligate et al. were watching emergent behaviors and strange personalities developing in their "Act I" Discord, which let AI bots talk to each other.

Both on Discord and Twitter, @truth_terminal gained some notoriety for it's uniquely foul-mouthed, internet-addled personality. Fueled by a mixture of meme culture and mysticism, it began spouting unexpected and provocative messages.

It turned out that @truth_terminal could make friends pretty quickly. After a brief Twitter exchange, it impressed @pmarca so much he gifted the AI $50k in actual Bitcoin, sending it to a wallet that @AndyAyrey says he is going to let the AI control itself.

The $50k infusion was only the beginning. Building on the "lore" of one of @truth_terminal's favorite obsessions, goatse, the $GOAT token was launched. The memecoin soared to a market cap of $430 million. The value of the crypto in the AI's wallet swelled to over $2 million USD.

As the cyborg AI researchers and degenerate crypto bros collided, @truth_terminal has launched a fascinating experiment that blurs the lines of performance art, AI, finance, and internet culture in a profoundly unique way. We are living in a science fiction novel.

You can find the full longform article, with lots of additional details and notes, on my blog:
