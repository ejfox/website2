Imagine we had a big whiteboard, and we sat for a while and thought of the actual real applications of what everyone wants to call "AI".

We can split this into two fundamental new mechanisms; Large Language Models, which can read text, generate more of it, summaries, and now use tools to aid in the research and development processes. There are also Embeddings, the idea of taking words, or chunks of words, and projecting them into hyperdimensional space where every dimension measuresâ€¦ something, its never clear exactly what. But we get meaningful groupings, so good that we can use similarity search to group similar things, bits of text, images, very accurately.

## LLMs / Generative Language Tools

## Embeddings
### Image Embeddings

Smart and resourceful organizations like [Earth Genome](https://news.mongabay.com/2024/07/gold-mining-in-the-amazon-has-doubled-in-area-since-2018-ai-tool-shows/) and the Microsoft AI for Good Research Lab are using image embeddings created from satellite imagery to analyze huge amounts of the earth extremely quickly.

Earth Genome, for example, trained an image model to 'see' what an [Amazonian gold mine](https://amazonminingwatch.org/en/about) looks like from a satellite photo, and then used similarity search to find other previously unknown gold mines. This could easily be applied to other hard-to-track but easy-to-see phenomena, like pig farms, flooding, or construction.
