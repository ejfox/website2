## THE IDEA

Finding patterns in data is easy—finding patterns that hold up to reporting is the actual job.

## THE BEATS

- Why data journalists keep finding "patterns" that don't survive scrutiny
- The NYPD misconduct analysis: what the network showed vs. what victims confirmed
- Correlation theater vs. causal journalism
- When to trust the math vs. when to trust the interview
- The replication problem: why I document everything

## OUTLINE

### The spreadsheet that looked like a story

[Hook: A compelling pattern that turned out to be an artifact of how the data was collected]

### Two types of data journalism

1. **Illustrative**: Data supports a story you already know is true
2. **Investigative**: Data reveals something no one knew

Most newsrooms do #1 and call it #2.

### What I learned from the NYPD project

Built a network of 29,915 officers. Found "catalyst" clusters.

The scary part: the math could have been wrong. The only way to know was to have George Joseph interview victims and see if their stories matched the network structure.

They did. But we didn't know that until we checked.

### The validation loop

1. Find pattern in data
2. Generate hypothesis
3. Test hypothesis with traditional reporting
4. Only publish if reporting confirms

Most data journalism skips step 3.

### Why I document methodology obsessively

If another city wants to replicate this analysis, they can. That's the point.
