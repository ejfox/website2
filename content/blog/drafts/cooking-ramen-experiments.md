## Ramen Experiments: Making Hell Fun

I keep coming back to ramen. Not just because it's cheap—though when you're bootstrapping a startup or freelancing between projects, that $1 packet definitely matters—but because there's something almost mythological about it in coder culture. "Living on ramen" isn't just about being broke; it's a badge of honor. You're supposed to subsist on instant noodles while you build the next big thing.

Then there's the anime factor. Those perfectly steamy bowls in Cowboy Bebop, the way characters slurp noodles while contemplating existence or planning their next move. Ramen becomes this symbol of simple pleasures amid chaos, of making the best of whatever you've got.

But let's be real: I've also been hella poor. Like, counting-change-for-groceries poor. In those moments, a quick trip to the store for a pack of ramen and an egg becomes this small salvation. You're looking forward to that bowl—the noodles, the fried egg on top—knowing that at least you can eat *something* tonight. There's a spirit of persistence that ramen unlocks for you, a reminder that you can make it through another day with just the basics.

For me, it's all about learning to "Make Hell Fun"—a core concept I keep coming back to. You start with the basics: a $1 packet of noodles and some bouillon. But then you start experimenting. A little sesame oil here, some tahini there, maybe some furikake, good soy sauce, fresh ginger, a drizzle of honey. Suddenly you're not just surviving—you're absolutely cooking with fire.

### The Experiments

There's the raw egg technique—crack it into the bowl, then pour the hot noodles and just a bit of that starchy cooking water over it, stirring fast until the egg cooks into silky ribbons. Add your hot sauce and you've got something that would cost $15 at a trendy ramen shop.

Then there are my ongoing experiments with buldak—those Korean fire noodles that are basically nuclear if you use the whole packet. I've learned to use maybe a third of the sauce packet, then build complexity with other ingredients. The heat becomes a foundation rather than an assault.

Ramen is this perfect playground for experimentation. Low stakes, high reward. If you mess up, you're out a dollar and five minutes. If you nail it, you've discovered something that could become your signature midnight meal.

### Making Hell Fun: Beyond the Bowl

The "Make Hell Fun" philosophy extends way beyond noodles. When I got arrested in 2016 after Trump was elected, I was taken to 1PP with a bunch of other protesters—including some random people who had just gotten swept up in the chaos. We sat in those cells, not knowing when we'd get home, energy heavy with uncertainty and fear.

So I started a game: everyone had to choose their "favorite cop" and explain why. Suddenly the energy shifted. We weren't just fish in a fishbowl anymore, passive victims waiting for processing. We were actively engaging with our situation, finding humor in the absurd, creating unity through shared defiance of the circumstances trying to break us down.

That's the essence of it—bringing this spirit to everything. When you're stuck in constraints, whether it's a $1 food budget, a jail cell, or any other form of hell life throws at you, you have a choice. You can let it grind you down, or you can find ways to play within the boundaries, to discover what's possible even when options seem limited.

Sometimes the best meals, the best stories, the best connections come from working with what you've got rather than waiting for what you want. The ramen experiments are just practice for everything else.
