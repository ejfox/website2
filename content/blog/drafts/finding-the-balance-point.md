## Finding the Balance Point

Is it even possible to make something that is low-effort and high-quality?

This question has been eating at me. I know in my heart that expression is the opposite of depression - that making things consistently keeps me sane.

But I'm also a perfectionist, or not perfection, but at least a good-ist whose broken brain rarely says "okay, that's good enough"

The evidence is mocking me: one of my "throwaway" YouTube videos - made to buy an extra week to make the "real" one - got 20x more engagement than anything I'd spent weeks polishing. Maybe people connected with unpolished authenticity in ways they never did with my careful productions, and what's the lesson there?

It's like learning to wheelie a motorcycle or hover your drone at the perfect altitude. Balance. Too little effort and you don't lift off. Too much and you flip backward. But there's a precise balance point where everything clicks - it feels effortless even though it took skill to get there. I haven't found that point yet.

### Ignoring Patterns

How is it possible to have profound experiences and still not integrate the insights? I've noticed people talk about transformative psychedelic experiences, then turn around and support policies that seem to contradict the empathy and interconnectedness those experiences typically reveal.

My own experiences with psychedelics have consistently reinforced certain insights - we're connected, empathy matters, love is fundamental. Yet some people have these profound experiences and appear to learn nothing lasting from them.

Both creative perfectionism and spiritual bypassing are results of the same type of mistake - trying to force an outcome instead of finding the natural balance point. Focusing on outcomes instead of journeys.

In creative work, I over-effort my way to sterile content that doesn't connect and saps me of energy. In psychedelics, some people over-effort their way to "enlightenment" without actually integrating the insights.

The question then is; how little effort can I put into a thing that still meets my own standards, and is it POSSIBLE to make something that is both low-effort and high-quality?
