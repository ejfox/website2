## Archival Video Footage of the Hudson Valley: A B-Roll Resource Guide

The Hudson Valley’s pre-2005 video archive is surprisingly rich, spanning folk music documentaries, industrial films, environmental activism footage, and art world documentation. **Pete Seeger’s 1965-66 Rainbow Quest television series** on Internet Archive offers the largest freely accessible collection, while the **Library of Congress American Folklife Center** holds 700+ unreleased film elements from Seeger’s personal archive. For industrial imagery, the **Prelinger Archives** contain dozens of railroad and tourism films capturing working-class river towns, and a rare **October 1924 film of Bear Mountain Bridge construction** survives at the University of South Carolina. This guide catalogues the most significant sources across all requested themes and locations.

### Pete Seeger footage anchors the folk music archive

The most extensive freely available source is **Rainbow Quest**, Seeger’s own television program recorded 1965-1966 at WNJU-TV Newark. Nearly all 39 episodes exist on Internet Archive, featuring performances by Mississippi John Hurt, Doc Watson, Judy Collins, Elizabeth Cotten, and the final episode with Johnny Cash and June Carter.

- **Rainbow Quest Episode 1** (Clancy Brothers, Tommy Makem): <https://archive.org/details/RainbowQuest01>
- **Episode 36** (Mississippi John Hurt, Hedy West): <https://archive.org/details/RainbowQuest36>
- **Episode 39** (Johnny Cash, June Carter - final episode): <https://archive.org/details/RainbowQuest39>

The **American Archive of Public Broadcasting** holds “Sounds of Summer: Pete Seeger on the Hudson” (1969), a 120-minute NET documentary of the Clearwater sloop arriving at Nyack on August 8, 1969. This footage captures the maiden Hudson River voyage, concerts in Memorial Park, and early appearances by **Don McLean** before “American Pie” fame. URL: <https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-512-r785h7cx72>

The **Library of Congress American Folklife Center** contains approximately **700 film and audio elements** donated by Pete and Toshi Seeger in 2003. Materials include footage shot 1955-1965, performances by Odetta, Big Bill Broonzy (1957), and documentation of Seeger’s Beacon home. Most require on-site viewing at the AFC reading room in Washington, but finding aids are available at <https://guides.loc.gov/seeger-folklife>.

#### Peekskill Riots documentation (1949)

Filmmaker Jon Scott Bennett created a **five-part docuseries on the Peekskill Riots**, using CBS Radio recordings from the National Archives and period newsreel footage. Episodes 3 and 4 cover the August 27 and September 4, 1949 violent incidents surrounding the Paul Robeson concert. Available at <https://www.jonscottbennett.com/films/>. Democracy Now! also holds a 2004 interview with Seeger recalling the riots: <https://www.democracynow.org/2014/1/31/video_pete_seeger_recalls_the_1949>

### Bob Dylan and the Woodstock era present complex rights challenges

True archival footage shot in the Hudson Valley during Dylan’s Woodstock retreat is extremely rare—much was lost when Dylan and Robbie Robertson edited “Eat the Document” without making safety copies. The surviving sources:

**Eat the Document (1966/1972)** exists as a bootleg on Internet Archive: <https://archive.org/details/eat-the-document>. This Dylan-directed documentary of his 1966 UK tour with The Hawks was edited at his Woodstock home during the post-motorcycle accident retreat. ABC Television rejected it; no official home video release exists.

**The Last Waltz (1978)** remains the most significant source for Band members discussing their Woodstock years and Dylan collaboration. Martin Scorsese’s documentary includes interviews about Big Pink and the Basement Tapes era. Selected for the **National Film Registry in 2019**, it streams on Netflix, Tubi, Apple TV, and is available through Criterion Collection.

**No Direction Home: Bob Dylan (2005)** by Scorsese draws on the Bob Dylan Archives, D.A. Pennebaker’s Eat the Document outtakes, and Murray Lerner’s Newport Folk Festival footage from 1963-1965. The documentary ends with Dylan’s 1966 motorcycle accident near Woodstock.

For footage inside Big Pink itself, **Lost Songs: The Basement Tapes Continued (2014)** includes reenactments filmed in the actual basement at West Saugerties with young actors portraying Dylan and The Band—the only known footage shot at that historic location.

#### Woodstock Festival footage

- **Woodstock 1970 Theatrical Cut Hi-Def Restoration**: <https://archive.org/details/woodstock-1970-theatrical-cut> (fan restoration)
- **1969 Woodstock Complete** (outtakes compilation): <https://archive.org/details/1969WoodstockComplete1>
- **Creation of the Woodstock 1969 Music Festival** (1994 VHS documentary): <https://archive.org/details/the-creation-of-the-woodstock-1969-music-festival-birth-of-a-generation>

Note: The Band’s Woodstock Festival performance remains **unreleased due to rights disputes** with Albert Grossman’s estate.

### Industrial heritage survives in railroad films and bridge construction footage

#### Bear Mountain Bridge (opened 1924)

The **University of South Carolina’s Moving Image Research Collection** preserves film footage shot in October 1924, just before opening. The NY State Bridge Authority featured this on bmb100.com for the bridge centennial. A new documentary, **“Bear Mountain Bridge: The First 100 Years”** by Beacon-based filmmaker Scott Snell, incorporates “never before seen footage.”

#### Railroad footage on Internet Archive

The **Prelinger Archives** hold extensive Hudson River railroad documentation:

### Hudson Highlands and nature footage captured in tourism films

**“Down Stream Highway” (1950)** is the single most valuable nature source, a Paramount “Grantland Rice Sportlight” film documenting boat races and outdoor activities on the Hudson. The 10-minute black-and-white film specifically shows:

- Storm King Mountain (scenic shots from river)
- Bear Mountain Suspension Bridge
- Peekskill (“city on bay along Hudson’s east side”)
- Hudson Highlands panoramas
- Trains running along the Hudson

### Art scene documentation spans Abstract Expressionism to Storm King

#### Abstract Expressionist footage

**“Jackson Pollock 51” (1951)** by Hans Namuth remains the most influential documentary footage of any Abstract Expressionist—10 minutes showing Pollock painting in his Springs, Long Island studio, including the iconic painting-on-glass sequence. The Hans Namuth Estate (Center for Creative Photography) controls rights.

**“Strokes of Genius: de Kooning on de Kooning” (1983)** captures the 79-year-old Willem de Kooning painting in his East Hampton studio. Narrated by Dustin Hoffman, directed by his artist neighbor Courtney Sale Ross. <https://www.artandobject.com/video/inside-willem-de-koonings-world>

#### Storm King Art Center

**Storm King Art Center’s institutional archives** (stormking.org/about/history/) include oral history interviews with artists and institutional leaders documenting the sculpture park’s development since 1960. Short films created from interview excerpts are available online.

#### PBS Art Documentaries

- **“The Hudson River School: Artistic Pioneers”** (74 minutes): Covers Thomas Cole, Durand, Cropsey, Bierstadt, and Church. Filmed at famous painters’ estates throughout the Hudson Valley. Available on Apple TV, Amazon Prime, or DVD at <https://shop.pbs.org/WC3822.html>

### Conclusion

The most immediately usable B-roll sources are the **Prelinger Archives railroad films** and **“Down Stream Highway” (1950)** for industrial and nature footage, the **Rainbow Quest episodes** for folk music atmosphere, and **Getty Images archival collections** for licensed Bear Mountain and river footage. The **Library of Congress Seeger Collection** represents the most significant untapped resource, requiring research visits but offering 700+ film elements spanning Beacon-area documentation, Clearwater activism, and folk revival performances unavailable elsewhere.

For working-class river town character, contact the **Newburgh Historical Society** about their 1960s aerial footage and the **Beacon Historical Society** for WWII-era hometown documentation. The urban renewal documentary **“Lost Rondout”** (hudsonvalleyhistoryandart.com) captures the destruction of Kingston’s waterfront district— thematically valuable for understanding what these towns lost. The **Hudson River Maritime Museum’s Donald Ringwald Collection** documents 110 years of steamboat commerce that defined these communities before the bridges.
