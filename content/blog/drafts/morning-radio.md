# Morning Radio

## The Idea

Your intentional start to the day — a smart, kind iOS companion that thoughtfully curates your morning reading experience.

## Outline

### The Problem with Feeds
- Everything demands attention equally
- Infinite scroll encourages mindless consumption
- No hierarchy, no curation, no calm

### The 6-Factor Priority Scoring Algorithm

| Factor | Points | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Recency | 0-30 | Fresh content priority |
| Source Quality | 0-20 | Premium sources stand out |
| Media Richness | 0-15 | Visual content valued |
| Temporal Relevance | 0-15 | Content from similar times |
| Tag Signals | 0-10 | Priority indicators |
| Completeness | 0-10 | Rich metadata bonus |

### The Morning Brief
- Top 3 curated items
- Elegant askew tiles (like newspaper clippings)
- Shows *why* each was chosen (transparency)

### Design Philosophy

**Intentionality Over Algorithm**
- Don't show everything, show what matters
- Every piece scored with transparency

**Organic Over Robotic**
- Askew tiles, staggered animations
- Natural spring physics

**Calm Technology**
- Intentionally slow animations (0.5s stagger)
- Encourage mindful consumption

### Historical Patterns
- "On this day" across your archive
- Temporal connections to past reading

### Technical Architecture
- Feature-based SwiftUI organization
- Supabase backend
- iOS 17+ modern features
- Zero lint warnings policy
