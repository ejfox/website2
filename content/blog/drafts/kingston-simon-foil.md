## Kingston PD FOIL Obstruction: Anthony Simon Shooting Investigation

### Summary

The City of Kingston's FOIL officer—who is rejecting a public records request for police discipline records following an officer-involved shooting—is married to the Police Chief who oversees the officer in question. The city has a documented pattern of FOIL obstruction, and the same FOIL officer was told by the state Committee on Open Government just three months ago that her email rejection policy violates state law. She's doing it again.

### The Shooting

**Date:** December 11, 2025, approximately 3:45 PM
**Location:** Dolsontown Road near McVeigh Road, Town of Wawayanda, Orange County, NY

**Parties:**

- **Anthony Simon**, 33, off-duty Kingston Police Officer (employed since March 2022)
- **Wallace F. Fisher**, 31, of Middletown, NY

**Incident:** A road rage confrontation spanning approximately one mile. Fisher exited his Volkswagen and approached Simon's Toyota pickup. A verbal altercation at the driver's side window turned physical. Police say Fisher brandished a knife. Simon discharged his firearm, striking Fisher twice in the neck and shoulder.

**Key details:**

- Simon used a personal weapon, not his duty weapon
- Dashcam footage from a third vehicle captured the incident
- Eyewitness Rob Parker: "The boy swing, he punched him and immediately three shots went off"
- Parker also noted: "It is unclear in the video if he is holding the knife as he takes a swing"
- Parker's assessment: "I feel like the whole thing could have been avoided. On both parties, I feel like they were wrong"

**Current status:**

- Fisher was transferred to Westchester Medical Center in critical but stable condition (as of Dec 12)
- No charges filed against either party as of Dec 16
- Investigation "active and ongoing" per State Police, "can still lead to charges"
- Simon placed on administrative duty by Kingston PD Chief Egidio Tinti

### The FOIL Request

**Submitted:** December 18, 2025 (one week after shooting)
**Method:** Email to nmalinoski@kingston-ny.gov (Police Records)
**Requester:** EJ Fox

**Records requested:**

1. All civilian complaints filed against Officer Simon
2. All internal/departmental complaints or charges
3. All disciplinary actions, sanctions, reprimands, suspensions, or other adverse employment actions
4. All use of force reports identifying Simon as having used force
5. Body-worn camera and dashboard camera footage from use of force incidents or complaint investigations
6. Any early warning system or performance monitoring flags
7. Badge number, date of hire, salary, and current rank/assignment

**Agency response:** Refused to process. Directed requester to resubmit via online portal or mail. Provided alternative contact email: nmalinoski@kingston-ny.gov

**Problem:** The provided email address (nmalinoski@kingston-ny.gov) returns a 550 permanent failure—it rejects incoming mail entirely. The agency directed a requester to a non-functional contact method while refusing to process a valid request.

### The Conflict of Interest

**Elisa Tinti** - City Clerk and Registrar, City of Kingston

- Designated FOIL Access Administrator for the City of Kingston
- **Married to Kingston Police Chief Egidio Tinti**

**Chief Egidio Tinti:**

- Oversees Officer Anthony Simon
- Made the decision to place Simon on administrative duty after the shooting
- His department is the subject of the FOIL request

**The conflict:** The person responsible for processing FOIL requests for police discipline records is married to the police chief whose officer is the subject of the request, and whose department's practices are under scrutiny.

    - "Tinti, who is married to Kingston Police Chief Egidio Tinti, will replace City Clerk Carly Winnie."

### Pattern of FOIL Obstruction

#### September 2025: Tinti's Email Ban (Overruled)

In September 2025, Tinti announced the city would no longer accept FOIL requests via email—the same policy now being applied to this request.

**Daily Freeman (Sept 22, 2025):**

>"On Monday, in an email response to an information request by the Freeman last week, City Clerk Elisa Tinti wrote that the city would 'no longer accept FOIL requests via email,' and laid out a complicated and cumbersome process for filing information requests."

**Committee on Open Government response:**

>Kristin O'Neil, the deputy director and counsel for the Committee on Open Government, said the city can't refuse email requests for information. "There's a provision in the statute that requires them to accept email requests."

**City's own counsel overruled Tinti:**

>"Assistant Corporation Counsel Matthew Jankowski agreed, saying in an interview Monday that the email sent by Tinti was incorrect and that the city must continue to accept requests via email."

#### Ongoing FOIL Litigation Against Kingston

Multiple lawsuits have been filed against the City of Kingston over FOIL practices:

**2022 - Kingstonian Calendar FOIL Suit:**

- Petitioners requested Mayor Noble's official calendar (Aug 2016 - March 2020)
- Request submitted March 9, 2020; response came almost two years later on Jan 6, 2022
- Lawsuit alleged: "the FOIL response consisted of incomplete and heavily redacted records which were not accompanied by any written explanation for the widespread redactions and omissions as required by law"
- Named respondents: City of Kingston, City Clerk Elisa Tinti, Corporation Counsel Barbara Graves-Poller, Mayor Steve Noble

**Source:** <https://www.dailyfreeman.com/2022/03/23/another-lawsuit-against-kingstonian-is-latest-in-at-least-a-dozen/>

**2025 - William Gottlieb Real Estate FOIL Suits:**

- Developer Neil Bender's firm has filed at least five lawsuits against Kingston
- Latest suit (Oct 31, 2025) relates to FOIL handling
- Includes a "FOIL the FOILs" request seeking all FOIL requests, responses, acknowledgements, emails, appeals and appeal responses from Jan 1, 2023 to July 15, 2025
- Suit argues six-month response time is "patently unreasonable"
- Names Elisa Tinti in her role as "records access officer"

### Statutory Violations

#### NY Public Officers Law § 89(3)(b) - Email Requirement

>"All entities shall, provided such entity has reasonable means available, accept requests for records submitted in the form of electronic mail…"

**Violation:** Kingston has email capability (they responded via email) but refused to process the emailed request. The statute says "shall accept"—not "may accept" or "accept unless they'd prefer you use a portal."

#### NY Public Officers Law § 89(3)(a) - 5-Day Response Requirement

>"within five business days of the receipt of a written request for a record reasonably described, shall make such record available to the person requesting it, deny such request in writing or furnish a written acknowledgement of the receipt of such request and a statement of the approximate date… when such request will be granted or denied"

**Violation:** The statute provides three options: (1) produce records, (2) deny with reasons, or (3) acknowledge and provide timeline. Kingston did none of these—instead demanding resubmission through a different channel. That's not a statutorily permitted response.

#### Non-Functional Contact Information

The agency directed the requester to contact nmalinoski@kingston-ny.gov. That address rejects all incoming mail (550 permanent failure). While not a direct statutory violation, providing non-functional contact information while refusing to process valid requests is inconsistent with FOIL's purpose of facilitating public access.

---

### Legal Options

#### Administrative Appeal

- Appeal to head of agency (Mayor or designated appeals officer)
- Agency has 10 business days to respond per § 89(4)(a)
- Failure to conform to § 89(3) "shall constitute a denial"

#### Committee on Open Government

- Can issue advisory opinions
- No enforcement power, but agencies sometimes comply to avoid escalation
- Already told Kingston in September 2025 that email rejection violates the law

#### Article 78 Proceeding

- Available after administrative appeal is denied per § 89(4)(b)
- Court may award attorney's fees if requester substantially prevails AND agency failed to meet statutory timelines
- Court shall award fees if requester substantially prevails AND agency had "no reasonable basis for denying access"
- Given Tinti was already told her email policy was illegal three months ago, "no reasonable basis" argument is strong

5. **Accountability gap:** Off-duty shooting, personal weapon, no charges, discipline records inaccessible
