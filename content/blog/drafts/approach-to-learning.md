## How I Learn New Things

One of the most important things to learn is how to learn. Isn't that kind of zen? Once you have mastered this superpower, you can apply this meta-tool to any field of study that interests and see results almost instantly. Unfortunately this is not something that can be taught easily, but comes through a process of self-learning and reflection.

This evolved from dropping out of high school (I never did get my GED, unfortunately, but I DID get accepted to SUNY Purchase College which I deferred from to go work for a startup in California). When traditional education doesn't work for you, you have to figure out how to learn on your own.

Your key insights were: find a subject, find open source documentation, find lectures/video lessons, find open source alternatives to expensive software, try to use the most PROFESSIONAL version of the equipment or software, jump in with projects that can quickly tell you if you're progressing, have a plan, trust the process.

### What's Worth Learning? Anything That Sparks Joy

What is worth learning? Anything that sparks joy - and not doubting that. I was so blessed to have a grandmother who loved me, and double-blessed she was a librarian. When you even THOUGHT of being interested in something she would bombard you with a series of books on the subject, which taught me to dive into something head-on through the primary source materials.

### Batching Related Concepts

I do try to batch or group topics that are similar - like if I'm studying one thing (HAM radio) that brings up another related thing (electrical engineering, electromagnetism), then it makes sense to learn those together because the concepts will reinforce each other.

Or I learn the history of a person along with the technical discoveries to hammer it into my head - like the fact no one believed Ohm when he first invented Ohm's Law. That's an informative story that makes the technical concept stick better than just memorizing V=IR.

### Reading the Docs (That No One Actually Reads)

After being around for a while I started to realize no one actually READS THE DOCS. Most tools you can just go through and freely read the manual and learn things that no one ever does or knows, even the people who use it every day. I think there is something special about gaining the ability to put on a good show in the background, make a nice cuppa tea and curl up to a LONG piece of documentation so you can learn how the thing works BACK TO FRONT.

I keep coming back to this insight: essential knowledge is often hiding in plain sight. Bear with me now, but take something as simple the nursery rhyme "row row row your boat, life is but a dream" - there's profound wisdom embedded in what we tell toddlers. Think about all the crucial wisdom in your life that has been repeated so often you barely hear it. The same principle applies to technical documentation - the real secrets are right there, practically screaming at you, but most people are too impatient to listen.
