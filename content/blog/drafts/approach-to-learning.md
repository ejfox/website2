## How I Learn New Things

Learning how to learn is the ultimate meta-skill. As a child, I quickly became disillusioned with traditional education, so I dropped out of high school and went straight to startup work. Since then I've had to reverse-engineer effective learning without the benefits of a direct teacher. Luckily I grew up in the age of the internet.

### Core Framework

**Following Joy**: Learn what genuinely interests you. My librarian grandmother taught me to flood myself with primary sources the moment I showed curiosity about anything.

**Batch Related Concepts**: Group related topics. [[../robots/preparation-as-practice]] → electrical engineering → electromagnetism. Learning Ohm's Law with Ohm's rejection story creates multiple memory pathways.

**Read the Fucking Manuals**: Most people skip documentation. Essential knowledge hides in plain sight - nursery rhymes contain profound wisdom, technical manuals contain competitive advantages.

**Ask Smart Questions**: Half the battle is asking intelligent questions, and taking the time to understand what you are asking will sometimes lead to the answer in itself

### Why This Works

- **Joy = Intrinsic Motivation**: Genuine interest drives persistence through difficulty
- **Batching = Memory Networks**: Connected concepts create multiple retrieval paths
- **Documentation = Competitive Edge**: Others use tutorials, you understand foundations
- **Meta-Learning = Infinite Scale**: Master the learning process once, apply to any array of subjects

### AI-Amplified Learning

I've generated 100+ AI learning plans covering HAM radio, EMT training, chess, welding, CAD, PICO-8 development. They follow this structure:

**Weekly Progression**: [HAM radio](../robots/ham-study-plan.md) = 4 weeks (basics → procedures → equipment → exam). Foundation before application.

**Multi-Modal Resources**: [Chess course](../robots/chess-course.md) = YouTube (GothamChess) + master games + daily puzzles. Multiple reinforcement channels.

**Real-World Integration**: [EMT prep](../robots/emt-course.md) includes blood exposure therapy. [Welding guide](../robots/learning-welding.md) has equipment acquisition phases ($500→$3000).

**Technical Depth**: [PICO-8 suite](../robots/pico-8-training.md) specifies sprite budgets, memory management, compression systems. Mini-games like BLAZE RUNNER (trail recognition) teach real skills through arcade mechanics.

**Memory Palaces**: HAM course uses "HAM Café" memory palace - restaurant sections represent frequency allocations.

AI amplifies rather than replaces core principles. Same joy-driven exploration, same documentation reading, now with comprehensive frameworks generated in minutes by my robot buddy.

### Continuous Evolution

Meta-learning evolves. Each subject teaches learning itself:

- HAM radio → systematic progression
- Chess → pattern recognition
- PICO-8 → constraints foster creativity

Beginner's mind applies to the learning process itself. Core principles stay constant (joy, batching, documentation), but implementation improves. AI provides structure, documentation provides depth, curiosity provides fuel.

The real meta-skill: never stop refining the process. Every learning plan, every manual read, every moment of curiosity - iterations in an endless experiment of human potential.
