## THE IDEA

The difference between a $5K visualization and a $50K visualization isn't 10x the pixels—it's whether it works when it matters.

## THE BEATS

- Why newsroom dataviz pricing is broken
- The hidden costs of "cheap" (maintenance, failures, reputation)
- What senior experience actually provides
- When to hire cheap (and when you absolutely shouldn't)
- The Kornacki test: would you bet your live broadcast on it?

## OUTLINE

### The $5K visualization

- Works in the demo
- Breaks with real data
- No documentation
- Developer disappears after launch
- You own the bugs forever

### The $50K visualization

- Works in production
- Handles edge cases
- Documented for your team
- Stress-tested before launch
- I'm around for launch support

### What you're actually paying for

Not my time. You're paying for:

1. **10 years of mistakes I've already made** (so you don't have to)
2. **Relationships with data providers** (I know who to call)
3. **Pattern recognition** (I've seen this failure mode before)
4. **Reputation stake** (my name is on it too)

### When to hire cheap

- Internal dashboards no one will see
- Prototypes that will be thrown away
- Projects with zero stakes

### When to hire expensive

- Anything going on TV
- Anything with legal/regulatory implications
- Anything that will be cited as a source
- Anything where failure is public

### The real question

Not "can we afford $50K?" but "can we afford to fail?"

*Notes: Don't be defensive about pricing. Be matter-of-fact. Include specific examples of what "failure" looks like in newsroom context.*
