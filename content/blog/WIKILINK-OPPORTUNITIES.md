# Wikilink Opportunities: Connecting the Thread-Weaving Posts

## How to Use This Guide

1. Open each file mentioned below
2. Find the line number
3. Add the suggested wikilink inline (Obsidian style: `[filenam](filenam)e]]`)
4. The connection should feel natural, not forced
5. Only add if it actually enhances the reading

## hidden-networks-of-warmth.md → Multiple Connections

**Line 23:** The preparation quote

```markdown

## General Wikilink Principles

**Good wikilinks:**

- Enhance understanding
- Create discovery paths
- Feel natural in context
- Add value to reader

**Bad wikilinks:**

- Every mention of a word
- Forced connections
- Link for link's sake
- Interrupt reading flow

**Best practice:**

- First mention in a section gets the link
- Use pipe syntax for natural reading: `[[file]]`
- Link to deepen, not just connect
- "See also" sections at end for related threads

## Quick-Add Checklist

- [ ] personal-apis.md → quantified-self link (line 24)
- [ ] hidden-networks-of-warmth.md → preparation link (line 23)
- [ ] hidden-networks-of-warmth.md → minimalism link (line 33, 37, 41)
- [ ] project-notes/scrapbook.md → interfaces link (line 21, 29)
- [ ] Add "Related Threads" to all robot posts
- [ ] Add cross-links between robot posts
- [ ] meta-patterns links to all 5 thread posts

## After Adding Links

Run Obsidian's graph view to see the connections emerge. The thread-weaving posts should become hub nodes connecting multiple projects and themes.

The goal: Anyone reading one post can discover the broader patterns through natural exploration.
