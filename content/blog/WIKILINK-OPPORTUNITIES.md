## General Wikilink Principles

**Good wikilinks:**
- Enhance understanding
- Create discovery paths
- Feel natural in context
- Add value to reader

**Bad wikilinks:**
- Every mention of a word
- Forced connections
- Link for link's sake
- Interrupt reading flow

**Best practice:**
- First mention in a section gets the link
- Use pipe syntax for natural reading: `[file|display tex](file|display-tex)t]]`
- Link to deepen, not just connect
- "See also" sections at end for related threads

## Quick-Add Checklist

- [ ] personal-apis.md → quantified-self link (line 24)
- [ ] hidden-networks-of-warmth.md → preparation link (line 23)
- [ ] hidden-networks-of-warmth.md → minimalism link (line 33, 37, 41)
- [ ] project-notes/scrapbook.md → interfaces link (line 21, 29)
- [ ] Add "Related Threads" to all robot posts
- [ ] Add cross-links between robot posts
- [ ] meta-patterns links to all 5 thread posts

## After Adding Links

Run Obsidian's graph view to see the connections emerge. The thread-weaving posts should become hub nodes connecting multiple projects and themes.

The goal: Anyone reading one post can discover the broader patterns through natural exploration.
