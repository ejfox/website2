# Claude Code Notes

## Video Script Format

Videos are "just ideas and a list" - from this we developed a consistent format for video-scripts/\*.md files.

### Structure

Add at the top of every video script (ADDITIVE - don't remove existing content):

```markdown
## THE IDEA

[One-line core concept - punchy, clear, with em dash for emphasis]

## THE BEATS

- [Opening curiosity gap - question to raise interest]
- [Another curiosity gap - creates retention]
- [Core concept/phrase to riff on]
- [Another concept]
- [etc.]

---

[Rest of original script content]
```

### Key Principles

1. **THE IDEA**: One clear sentence capturing the core concept
   - Use em dashes (—) for emphasis
   - Keep it punchy and direct

2. **THE BEATS**: Flat list of concepts to cover
   - Start with 1-2 curiosity gap questions
   - Use short phrases, nouns, concepts
   - Avoid adjectives/adverbs when possible
   - Use symbols: =, →, ↔, vs, +
   - NOT production details (no "TikTok montage" or "screen recordings")
   - ONLY the ideas/concepts to riff on

3. **Style**: Concise, punchy
   - "Difficulty ≠ value"
   - "Hard work + joy = dance partners"
   - "Curiosity = engine of joy"
   - "Ancient wisdom → modern tech"

### Examples

Good beats:

- Why do smart people fail at complex problems?
- What if the problem isn't the parts, but how they connect?
- Competence = beauty and artistry
- Jack-of-all-trades vs master of one

Bad beats:

- TikTok montage showcasing skills
- Screen recordings and code snippets
- Use engaging visuals
