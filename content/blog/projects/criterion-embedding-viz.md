Generated embeddings for every film in the Criterion Collection and visualized them in semantic space. You can see clusters of French New Wave films hanging out together, film noir huddled in its own corner.

Used UMAP dimension reduction to map high-dimensional film descriptions into 2D space where similar films naturally cluster. It's basically a map of cinema history organized by vibes rather than chronology or geography.
