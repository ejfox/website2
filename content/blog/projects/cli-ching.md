I've always been fascinated by the I Ching, so naturally I built a terminal version that brings this 3,000-year-old divination system to the command line. You still toss real coins - preserving the meditative ritual - while the app handles the complex hexagram calculations and LLM-powered interpretations.

There's something delightfully contradictory about consulting an ancient oracle through a terminal prompt. My favorite feature is the consultation history saved to `.iching-throws` - lets you track patterns in your questions over time.
