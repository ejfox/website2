## The Problem

Photo prints hide the technical details that matter to photographers. Every print I order from CVS or Walgreens comes out looking the same—no context about the camera settings, lens, or exposure choices that went into making the image.

## What I Built

[EXIF Photo Printer](https://exifprinter.ejfox.com)—a macOS app that adds camera metadata to your photo borders before printing.

**Workflow:**
1. Drag photos into the app
2. EXIF data is extracted automatically
3. Pick your print size (4x6, 5x7, 8x10, etc.)
4. Download print-ready files at 300 DPI

**Each print shows:**
- Camera model and lens
- Aperture, shutter speed, ISO
- Capture date
- Additional metadata when available

## Why This Exists

I wanted my printed photos to feel like pages from a field notebook—the technical choices visible alongside the image. Now when I look at a print, I remember *how* I made it, not just what I saw.
