During the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic, I worked on [Carnegie Melon University's](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2020/04/24/carnegie-mellon-maps-offer-more-data-for-covid-19-forecasting.aspx) [COVIDcast project](https://delphi.cmu.edu/epidemic-signals/), prototyping data visualizations and user interactions to help the public better understand the a variety of data being collected across the country on trends in hospitalization, transmission, and movement.
