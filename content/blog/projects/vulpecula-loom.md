An Electron desktop app to customize the experience of talking to different LLM models through OpenRouter. Added a bunch of power user convenience features for myself, like seeing the total token usage, cost per token, and being able to prune out large messages from the history if desired. My goal is to keep adding on to it and using it as my daily-driver interface for different models.
