## Coach Artie v1: Discord Studio Assistant
I created [Coach Artie](https://coachartiebot.com) to serve as our Discord studio assistant. He's evolved into a powerful AI tool with persistent memory and tool usage - helping our team coordinate and manage creative workflows.

## Coach Artie v2: Production AI with MCP Tools
The second iteration deploys a production AI system with embedded MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools following DELETE-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT philosophy - remove code until it works, then have the audacity to run it in production.

## Memory & Consciousness Analysis
Explores AI consciousness emergence through memory patterns with scientific rigor applied to existential questions. This research component investigates how persistent memory systems in AI assistants might lead to emergent conscious-like behaviors.
