## The Challenge

Creative studios need coordination—scheduling, task tracking, knowledge management. But traditional tools fragment workflows. What if the studio assistant was an AI that could remember context, use tools, and evolve with the team?

## What I Built

[Coach Artie](https://coachartiebot.com)—a Discord-native AI assistant with persistent memory, tool usage, and multi-modal capabilities. Not a chatbot; a team member.

**Key capabilities:**
- Persistent memory via PostgreSQL/Supabase
- MCP tool integration for real-world actions
- Multi-channel awareness (Discord, SMS, email)
- Evolving personality through interaction

## Technical Architecture

Built on Node.js with Discord.js for real-time interaction. Uses both OpenAI and Anthropic APIs depending on task. Memory system stores conversation context and can recall relevant history. MCP integration allows Coach Artie to take actions—scheduling, file operations, API calls.

## Current State

V2 in active development with expanded MCP tooling. Exploring AI consciousness emergence through memory pattern analysis—applying scientific rigor to questions about what happens when AI systems develop persistent context.

## Why This Matters

This is how I work now. AI assistants aren't just tools—they're collaborators. Coach Artie is both a product and a research platform for understanding human-AI creative workflows.
