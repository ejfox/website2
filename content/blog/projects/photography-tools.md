I love being able to reference the technical details when editing photography—aperture, shutter speed, ISO, all the little choices that go into making a photograph. But most photo prints completely ignore this data, treating it like metadata to be hidden away in EXIF tags that nobody ever sees. So I made a little app to add the EXIF data to the margins of prints you might get from CVS, Walgreens, or Wal-Mart (don't use them for photo prints, I learned the hard way.)
