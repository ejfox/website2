I worked with the [Washington Post Opinion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2020/01/09/washington-post-opinions-launches-interactive-election-simulator/) section and contributor David Byler as well as the Washington Post interactives team to create a unique interactive, that would let users game out different potential election scenarios based on the latest poll results.
