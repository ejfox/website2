I'm a big fan of ambient visualization; taking a data point and embedding it in your peripheral vision. I remember reading an essay where the author wore a belt that vibrated directionally; and he found himself innately not getting lost with the constant indicator of north being applied indirectly.

I think there's probably something similar there to be done with a desktop background, and so I wanted to lay the groundwork. This is a node js web server that runs on your Mac OS computer, and after being granted permissions, it will change your desktop background to whatever color the webhook receives. While the server is running, this theoretically lets any application change the desktop bacgkround on-the-fly, which is fun.
