Tools for making deployment less painful. Built these to scratch my own itches around self-hosting and rapid prototyping.

**[Dockrune](https://github.com/ejfox/dockrune)** - Self-hosted deployment daemon written in Go. Push to GitHub, automatically deploys to Docker on your VPS. Like a tiny Vercel you control.

**[Smallweb.run](https://github.com/ejfox/smallweb.run)** - Collection of small websites and the infrastructure to host them. Exploring the idea of many tiny sites instead of one big one.

Both projects focus on keeping deployment simple and giving developers full control over their infrastructure.
