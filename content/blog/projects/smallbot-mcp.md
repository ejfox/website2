## The Problem

You have an idea for a website. Maybe it's a visualization, a tool, a quick demo. But between "idea" and "deployed" is an hour of DNS configuration, build pipelines, and deployment scripts. By then, the energy is gone.

## What I Built

[Smallbot MCP](https://github.com/ejfox/smallbot-mcp)—an MCP server that lets AI assistants (Claude, etc.) create and deploy websites instantly using [Smallweb](https://www.smallweb.run).

**How it works:**
- Say "make me a site about northeastern trees"
- AI generates the code via MCP tools
- Smallweb deploys it to a real URL
- Done in seconds, not hours

## Why MCP?

Model Context Protocol gives AI assistants the ability to take real actions—not just generate text. Smallbot is a practical example: give Claude the tools to create websites, and it actually creates websites.

Made a [video with Smallweb's creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thIt-JXYbco) showing the setup. Part of my broader work on AI-human creative workflows and [indieweb philosophies](https://www.are.na/ej-fox/neo-internet-philosophy).
