I've deployed way too many projects to way too many different platforms, and somewhere along the way I realized that most deployment tools are optimized for companies with dedicated DevOps teams, not for people who just want to push code and have it run somewhere. Same with development tools—most of them assume you have infinite time to configure them.

These are the tools I built out of frustration with the status quo. Each represents a design philosophy: reduce cognitive overhead, eliminate unnecessary complexity, and optimize for the 80% use case.

## Project List

1. [dockrune](https://github.com/ejfox/dockrune): Self-hosted deployment daemon: push-to-deploy from GitHub to Docker VPS.

2. [room302-template](https://github.com/ejfox/room302-template): Nuxt template with personality in the name bringing character even to boilerplate code.

3. [smallweb-starter](https://github.com/ejfox/smallweb-starter): Lightweight application starter rejecting bloated modern web complexity for focused simplicity.
