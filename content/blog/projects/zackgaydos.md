I wanted to make a website for my friend Zack, who makes excellent creative work and deserves an outlet besides Instagram.

Zack's the type of guy to be camping on a rare Maine island only accessible by ferry and with questionable cell reception. I knew it had to be pretty low-friction to update; so I decided to allocate a phone number on Twilio just for him. He can text that number anywhere, via SMS, and his blog updates instantly.
