In 2013 I joined [Vocativ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocativ) a small media outlet in New York focused on the dark web, as Graphics Editor. I worked to create daily data visualizations for breaking news and data investigations. I also created the newsroom dataviz style guide under direction of [Pentagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagram_(design_firm)), and lead our small team day-to-day.
