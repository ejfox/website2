## The Context

[Subway Builder](https://subwaybuilder.xyz) is Colin's indie transit sim—think Mini Metro meets real-world transit planning. I've been helping with modding tools and building mods that push what the game can do.

## What I Built

A collection of mods that add realism, data viz, and NYC flavor:

**Day/Night Theme Cycle**
Interface automatically shifts between light (6am-6pm) and dark themes based on in-game time. Small touch, surprisingly immersive.

**Bushwick Express**
NYC-themed career mission with geographic passenger tracking. Build your network connecting Brooklyn to Manhattan, hit ridership milestones, unlock achievements. Local flavor in a global game.

**Commute Sankey**
Real-time data visualization of passenger flows through your network. See mode-share percentages, route ridership breakdowns. Turns your transit network into a legible data story.

**KML/KMZ Export**
Export your metro designs to Google Earth. Your fantasy subway system, rendered as real geography. Useful for presentations, screenshots, or just seeing how your network would look IRL.
