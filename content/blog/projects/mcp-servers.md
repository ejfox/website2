Built a few Model Context Protocol servers to extend AI assistants with specialized capabilities. MCP lets you give Claude and other LLMs access to tools and data sources.

**[Smallbot MCP](https://github.com/ejfox/smallbot-mcp)** - Generates small websites from natural language prompts. Tell it what you want, it builds and deploys it.

**[MuckRock MCP](https://github.com/ejfox/muckrock-mcp)** - 20+ tools for filing and managing FOIA requests. Highly experimental but functional integration with MuckRock's API.

**[Vulpes Spotify MCP](https://github.com/ejfox/vulpes-spotify-mcp)** - Already mentioned elsewhere but worth noting in the MCP collection. Control Spotify from your AI conversations.
