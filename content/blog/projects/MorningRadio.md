## The Problem

The first thing most people do when they wake up is grab their phone and doom-scroll. News apps are designed to maximize engagement, not inform. Social feeds are designed to maximize time-on-platform, not satisfaction. I wanted something different.

## What I'm Building

MorningRadio—an iOS app designed to be a healthy "first screen." Quick news summaries, curated links from my Pinboard bookmarks, and audio briefings. The TikTok-style vertical swipe interaction, but filled with things that actually make your morning better.

**Design principles:**
- Finite content—you can reach the end
- Audio-first for eyes-free consumption
- Curated sources, not algorithmic feeds
- Satisfying, not addicting

## Current State

Active development. Experimenting with home screen widgets (harder than expected on iOS) and audio synthesis for spoken briefings.
