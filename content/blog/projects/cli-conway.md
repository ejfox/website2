I've always been fascinated by Conway's Game of Life and its emergent complexity from simple rules. As a terminal enthusiast, I naturally wanted a version I could run in my command line - like a dorky tamogotchi or futuristic lava lamp.

Built a minimalist implementation using braille unicode characters for higher resolution than typical ASCII. Creates emergent patterns from simple cellular automata rules.
