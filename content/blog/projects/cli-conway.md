I've always been fascinated by Conway's Game of Life and its emergent complexity from simple rules. As a terminal enthusiast, I naturally wanted a version I could run right in my command line and maybe play in the background like a dorky tamogotchi or futuristic lava lamp.

CLI-Conway is my minimalist implementation that brings cellular automata to your terminal. It's a text-based version where each cell is represented by using braille unicode characters, allowing it to perform at a higher resolution than just per-character.
