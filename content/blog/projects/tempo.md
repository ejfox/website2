# Tempo

A Swift/SwiftUI iOS application for tempo and rhythm management, designed to help users maintain consistent timing and rhythm in various contexts.

## Overview

Tempo is built using modern iOS development practices with SwiftUI for the user interface and Core Data for persistent storage. The app follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines while providing a clean, intuitive experience for rhythm-based activities.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **SwiftUI**: Declarative UI framework for modern iOS interfaces
- **Core Data**: Local persistence with Tempo.xcdatamodeld schema
- **Swift Package Manager**: Dependency management and configuration

### Project Structure
- **TempoApp.swift**: Main application entry point
- **ContentView.swift**: Primary user interface
- **Persistence.swift**: Core Data stack and data management
- **Tempo.entitlements**: App capabilities and permissions

## Development Status

The project is currently in active development with the basic iOS project structure established. The Core Data model is configured for persistent storage of tempo-related data, and the SwiftUI framework is set up for responsive, native iOS interactions.

## Potential Applications

While still in early development, Tempo could serve various rhythm and timing needs:
- Music practice and metronome functionality
- Productivity timing (Pomodoro technique)
- Exercise and workout pacing
- Mindfulness and breathing exercises

The flexible architecture allows for expansion into multiple tempo-based use cases while maintaining a clean, focused user experience.
