When I was 18 I had a choice to make; go to college or join the San Francisco-based start-up that had offered me a job. I chose to move my life across the country and start my first full-time job as a Staff Designer at [Visual.ly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual.ly#:~:text=Visual.ly%20is%20structured%20both,Education%20to%20Business%20or%20Politics.) an [infographics showcase and marketplace](https://allthingsd.com/20110713/visual-ly-wants-to-bring-nifty-charts-and-graphs-to-the-rest-of-us/).

I created dozens of static infographics, and also learned D3 from my incredible colleagues, and I've been creating dataviz ever since.
