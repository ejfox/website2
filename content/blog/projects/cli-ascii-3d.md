Sometimes when I'm coding late at night, I need something oddly hypnotic to stare at in the corner of my screen. That's why I built cli-ascii-3d - a completely unnecessary but strangely satisfying ambient ASCII art generator for your terminal.

It's basically a lava lamp for terminal dwellers. The shifting patterns of characters create an ever-changing dimensional space that's perfect for those moments when you need to zone out and let your subconscious work on a problem.

The animation speed and node count parameters let you dial in exactly the right level of visual chaos - from gentle waves (`-b 2 -s 0.5`) to hyperspeed matrix-style madness (`-b 20 -s 5.0`). I personally keep it running on a spare terminal while debugging, and more than once I've had that "aha!" moment while staring blankly at the patterns.
