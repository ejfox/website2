Sometimes when I'm coding late at night, I need something oddly hypnotic to stare at. Built cli-ascii-3d as a completely unnecessary but strangely satisfying ambient ASCII art generator - basically a lava lamp for terminal dwellers.

The animation parameters let you dial in exactly the right level of visual chaos. I keep it running on a spare terminal while debugging - more than once I've had that "aha!" moment while staring blankly at the patterns.
