Me and [my studio](https://room302.studio) worked with the [Wildlife Conservation Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_Conservation_Society) to create [a microsite]([https://hopeunderwater.com/](https://hopeunderwater.com/)) telling the story of coral reefs that may defy the odds and survive climate change.
