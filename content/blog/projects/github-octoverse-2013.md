I worked closely with GitHub's internal data, design, and visualization teams [in 2013](https://github.blog/news-insights/the-library/state-of-the-octoverse-2013-edition/) to create a [year-in-review website](https://dribbble.com/shots/1742918/attachments/282046?mode=media) that included a number of visualizations, including a spinning globe showing the locations of actions taken on GitHub, powered by GitHub's enormous [BigQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuery) database.
