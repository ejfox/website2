I spearheaded an internal effort to develop [new D3-powered mapping software](https://www.newscaststudio.com/2018/11/05/nbc-big-board-update/) for visualizing election maps and results live - the touchscreen app wielded by Steve Kornacki known as the "Big Board". Built for real-time county-level election analysis.
