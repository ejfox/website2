Reporter Ben Popken approached me with a unique mission: analyze 200k+ tweets from known Russian trolls. I jumped at the opportunity to help.

Partnering with Neo4j analysts, we applied OSINT principles to uncover patterns. Created interactive D3 visualizations and static graphics showing how trolling spiked during debates and pushed ideologies from *both sides* of the political spectrum - visualized as flowing streamgraphs.

The trolls had helpfully hashtagged everything, providing another feature to explore. Our work was later validated when FiveThirtyEight released [2 million more Russian troll tweets](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-were-sharing-3-million-russian-troll-tweets/) showing similar patterns.

[Neo4J released the dataset on Github](https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/twitter-trolls) as well
