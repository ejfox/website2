## The Work

On NBC News' Foundry team, I created bespoke longform articles—each one a unique approach to video, data visualization, and storytelling on the web. These [specials](https://www.nbcnews.com/specials) tackled complex topics that needed more than a standard article format.

## Selected Projects

### Does America Need Another Prison? (2018)
Investigative piece mapping the overlap between declining coal country and proposed prison sites. Custom D3 maps showing geographic correlation.
