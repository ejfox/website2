I've always believed that if you're going to spend half your life in a terminal, it might as well feel like a cyberpunk movie. These tools explore how joy-drivem devex design can transform the routine into something that makes even doing your chores fun.

Each tool follows the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well, but with enough personality to make you smile when you run them.

They represent my approach to design: functionality first, but never underestimating the power of delight.
