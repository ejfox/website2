Along with Gerald Rich, and the Vocativ data team, I received a [Knight Prototype Fund](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/20-ideas-receive-support-knight-prototype-fund-media-and-information-projects/) grant to create an initial prototype for [Dataproofer](https://github.com/dataproofer/Dataproofer) an open source tool to check data for reliability, missing data, and outliers.
