Along with Gerald Rich and the Vocativ data team, I received a [Knight Prototype Fund](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/20-ideas-receive-support-knight-prototype-fund-media-and-information-projects/) grant to create [Dataproofer](https://github.com/dataproofer/Dataproofer) - an open source tool to check data for reliability, missing data, and outliers. Built as an Electron desktop app for journalists.
