## Hudson Valley Systems & Trail Mapping Project

The Hudson Valley Systems & Trail Mapping Project aims to create more than just a set of maps. Our goal is to develop a multi-faceted tool that strengthens our communities' ability to explore, understand, and care for the landscapes we call home. By weaving together detailed geographic information, emergency response resources, and local knowledge, these maps will serve as a foundation for building resilient physical and social infrastructure.

At its core, this project recognizes that our trails, radio waves, and local knowledge are more than just lines on a map or frequencies in the air. They represent conduits of connection - ways for people to engage with the natural world, share knowledge and resources, and support each other in times of need. By mapping these networks and making that information accessible to everyone, we enable more people to plug into and strengthen the systems that sustain us.

For recreational users, these maps will provide the confidence to venture further and the wisdom to tread lightly. Detailed trail information, land navigation aids, and safety resources will empower hikers, ecologists, and explorers to immerse themselves in the landscape while minimizing their impact and risk.

For emergency responders and community organizations, the maps will serve as a critical coordination tool. Comprehensive coverage of access points, infrastructure systems, and water sources will enable faster and more targeted responses to incidents. Radio communication data will ensure responders can stay connected and informed even in challenging terrain.

The approach embodied in these maps - one that recognizes the interdependence of natural and human systems - aligns with the anarchist principles of mutual aid and community resilience. By emphasizing the connections between the land, our infrastructure, and our social fabric, the maps encourage a holistic view of community wellbeing. They remind us that by caring for our environment and its resources, we create the conditions for our own collective freedom. The maps invite us to think beyond individual survival and toward the creation of resilient, regenerative communities. By revealing the hidden potential in our landscapes and the power of decentralized coordination, they inspire us to build systems of mutual support that can weather any storm.

For groups operating on principles of autonomy and direct action, these maps offer a means to put those principles into practice. By decentralizing knowledge of the land and its resources, they enable independent action and reduce reliance on official authorities.

In times of civil unrest, when the facade of social stability cracks, it is often these grassroots, community-based groups that hold the line and provide the most immediate and effective support. By equipping them with detailed, holistic understandings of their environment and its potential, we invest in the resilience and autonomy of our communities. We create the conditions for mutual aid to flourish, even in the most challenging circumstances.

In this sense, the maps become more than static representations - they are invitations to engage with the land as a living system that supports and responds to us. They challenge us to think beyond individual uses and interests and to recognize our role in a complex web of relationships. They remind us that by caring for the land and each other, we strengthen the resilience of both.

In the spirit of the open-source software (OSS) movement, the process of creating these maps is as important as the maps themselves. By carefully documenting our methodologies, data sources, and design decisions, we create a template that can be adapted and replicated by other communities looking to map their own landscapes of resilience.

Just as fungal networks quietly and persistently weave through the underground, sharing nutrients and information across vast ecosystems, the open-source sharing of cartographic insights can create a resilient, decentralized network of local knowledge and empowerment that puts us ahead of our adversaries. Each independent mapping project becomes a node in this network, adapting our shared template to its unique local context while also feeding back its learnings and innovations into the collective knowledge base.

This approach offers a powerful tool for building autonomous, resilient information sources. By creating and sharing these maps, they not only strengthen their own local capacities, but also contribute to a larger ecology of resistance and mutual aid.

### **Forestpunk OSM Contribution: Mapping for Mutual Aid**

**Why We Map**: In the Forestpunk ethos, maps are more than tools—they are acts of care. Every updated trail, repeater location, or water source is a gift to those who walk after us. By contributing to OpenStreetMap (OSM), we strengthen the invisible networks that sustain freedom, resilience, and connection in wild places. Mapping isn’t just preparation—it’s a form of decentralized empowerment.

---

### **The Forestpunk Approach to OSM**
1. **Decentralized Knowledge**: Your updates make critical local data accessible to anyone, breaking reliance on centralized systems.
2. **Regenerative Action**: Each contribution enhances the land’s role as a resource for safety, exploration, and mutual support.
3. **Radical Connection**: By mapping, you weave the forest and digital realms together, ensuring technology whispers rather than controls.

---

### **How To Start Contributing**
1. **Create an Account**:
   - Visit [openstreetmap.org](https://openstreetmap.org) and sign up.
2. **Learn the Basics**:
   - Use the **iD Editor** (in-browser) for beginner-friendly edits.
   - Install **JOSM** (advanced) for GPS tracks, bulk edits, and detailed tagging.
3. **Collect Field Data**:
   - Record GPS tracks with a smartphone (OsmAnd, Gaia GPS).
   - Take geotagged photos or notes using apps like **Mapillary** or **StreetComplete**.
   - Annotate printed maps with field observations (Field Papers).
4. **Follow Best Practices**:
   - Tag accurately: Use OSM tagging guides to classify features (e.g., `highway=path`, `amenity=drinking_water`).
   - Validate edits: Check for errors before uploading.
   - Document changes clearly in your upload description.
