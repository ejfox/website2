## MORNING RADIO üìª

*Your personal morning show, mixing world updates, creative inspiration, and project continuity*

### Core User Context (Direct Quotes)

>"Wake up in a sunbeam, my cat is cuddling next to me, I'm well-rested and ready for the day, even a little bit bored; 'What to do?'"

>"Morning coffee and spliff time is sacred; it controls the whole day, it is profoundly powerful. The things I think about, consume, and direct my intentionality towards in that time has huge impacts on my life."

>"I just wanna know the baseline stuff for my happiness; did any huge bombs go off in the world, is it going to rain today, are my friends all okay, ok, looks good, now to get to work"

#### DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY

>"I need to build the habit template and iterate on improving the app in a daily iterative fashion, like if I spend 15-30 minutes adding/improving features on it at the end of every day for the next morning it would grow in a slow curated careful way"

#### TARGET USER CLARITY

>"a lot of this is formatted around a very specific type of weirdo (me!)"

- Initially building for one user
- No need for multi-user complexity yet

#### ESSENTIAL TONE

>"I wish it was like‚Ä¶ a more measured Ram Dass-y tone"
vs
>"YOU'RE IN AMERICA WHERE EVERYTHING IS LOUD AND SWEET! BOOM BOOM BANG BANG"

#### PROJECT REDISCOVERY

>"OH YEAH! I forgot about those photos I took at X, I should edit and publish those" or "OH YEAH! I wrote 80% of that script, I should finish it"

#### PUBLISHING CYCLE

>"Oh yeah! I published that code on GitHub, now I should make a blog post for it!" or "Oh yeah! I published that blog post, now I should make a video for it!"

6. SUCCESS METRICS
- More creation, less consumption
- Better documentation of work
- Maintained morning inspiration
- Reduced doomscrolling

### Technical Foundations
- Cloud-based (Fly.io initial choice, cloudflare potential alternative)
- iOS first (SwiftUI)
- Dark mode / light mode linked to system
- Offline-first architecture
- Background refresh critical

MOBILE MARIA (üë©‚Äçüé®): Don't forget the crucial timing context:

>"30 minutes (doomscrolling) is good and fine, but this morning I woke up at 9 and I didn't get out of bed until 11 and that felt‚Ä¶ bad"

CLARENCE THE JANITOR (üßπ): *making final sweeps*

And remember the core balance:

>"I want to plan my day with the same low-intensity interactions (as social media), scrolling, clicking, right- but instead of just sorting through the feeds I'm actually planning my day and making legitimate progress"

### Existing Systems Integration
1. DAILY PRACTICES
   - Morning pages
   - GTD with Things
   - Obsidian for project notes
   - Regular RSS reading via Reeder

2. CORE DAILY TASKS

   >"Every day on my todo list, there are 3 things [‚Ä¶] aspirational but core to the type of person I want to be:"
   - Meditate

   - Make something and publish it
   - Write in journal

### Documentation & Publishing Flow
- Currently uses Obsidian vault on iCloud
- Frontmatter controls publishing (`share: true`)
- Weekly notes format with emoji headers
- Struggle with consistent documentation
- Need for "private by default, intentional sharing"

### Current Pain Points
1. MORNING ROUTINE

   >"I open up social media and scroll a bit; I get some updates on the local wildfire, a new restaurant that opened up in Beacon from Facebook. On Twitter, I learn about new AI technique [‚Ä¶] On Instagram I stumble across a really cool reel"
   - Seeking inspiration but finding distraction

   - Need for filtered, meaningful updates

2. DOCUMENTATION CHALLENGES

   >"I profoundly struggle with the latter part. I think, after 32 years on this planet, it's mostly about like, not putting myself out there so I won't be 'rejected'"

3. PROJECT CONTINUITY

   >"I'll look back and over the course of the week i made like 3 weird little command line tools, a weird art thing, an animation in after effects, and a weird generative modular synth thing"
