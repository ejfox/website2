ForestMesh: Resilience Through Connection

“Weaving a network of preparedness, exploration, and mutual aid.”

ForestMesh.com is a privacy-first, self-hostable platform designed for groups and communities to build resilient ecosystems through preparedness, resource coordination, and decentralized communication. By combining mapping, lightweight inventory tracking, and gamified progress, ForestMesh empowers you to thrive in uncertainty.

Whether you’re planning a camping trip, preparing for emergencies, or building a decentralized community, ForestMesh is your toolkit for resilience.

Core Features

1. Map-Centric Interface

• Interactive Mapping: Use OpenStreetMap (OSM) integration to map trails, repeater coverage, water sources, and critical locations.

• Group-Specific Heatmaps: Visualize group preparedness levels and gaps in resource distribution.

• Offline Maps: Access critical geographic information even when disconnected.

2. Group Coordination

• Private, Encrypted Groups: Create groups with strict privacy controls, self-hosting options, and PGP-verified membership.

• Role Assignment: Assign roles like Navigator, Medic, or Communicator based on skills and resources.

• Subgroups: Break larger groups into specialized teams (e.g., “Water Team” or “Shelter Team”).

3. Inventory and Resource Tracking

• Inventory Light: Quickly log key items with Yes/No flags and optional maintenance dates.

• Resource Sharing: Share resources anonymously or within trusted groups to avoid duplication.

• Gap Analysis: Identify missing critical items and resource imbalances.

4. Gamified Progression

• Preparedness Scoring: Track individual and group readiness with heatmaps and score dashboards.

• Challenges: Participate in group challenges like off-grid drills, mapathons, or scenario-based readiness tests.

• Achievements: Unlock badges for milestones like “Fully Stocked First Aid” or “Mapped Critical Infrastructure.”

5. Decentralized Communication

• LoRa/Radio Integration: Build low-bandwidth communication networks with Meshtastic or similar tools.

• Offline Syncing: Share group data locally via USB or QR codes when connectivity is unavailable.

• Amateur Radio Support: Interact with ForestMesh via amateur radio for ultimate resilience.

6. Educational Tools

• Scrollytelling PGP Guide: Teach non-technical users to set up encryption keys through an engaging story-driven guide.

• Skill Evaluations: Offer quizzes to identify strengths and suggest roles.

• Scenario Training: Prepare for specific disasters (e.g., power outages, wildfires) with interactive modules.

How It All Comes Together

The Ecosystem

ForestMesh isn’t just an app—it’s an interconnected system:

• Maps: Anchor all activities with shared maps.

• Groups: Use shared resources and secure communication to collaborate.

• Inventory: Track and share tools across your network.

• Challenges: Strengthen group bonds through gamified activities.

Example Use Case

• Disaster Prep Group:

A local group uses ForestMesh to map emergency shelters and track shared supplies like first-aid kits and water filters. They run monthly challenges to improve readiness and sync data offline when needed.

• Camping Crew:

A group of friends plans a trip, dividing roles (Cook, Navigator) and logging shared gear like tents and stoves. They use the heatmap to check supply gaps and sync maps for offline use.

Values

1. Privacy-First: Your data, your rules. No tracking or analytics.

2. Decentralized by Design: Self-host or run locally for full control.

3. Resilience as Play: Gamify preparedness for fun and engagement.

4. Freedom Through Connection: Build systems that empower autonomy while fostering community.

**Date:** September 30, 2024

**Subject:** Development Plan for SurvivalHub – Building a Secure, Localized Preparedness Platform

---

## **Introduction**

Dear Team,

I am thrilled to introduce **SurvivalHub**, our innovative project aimed at empowering communities to form resilient, well-prepared affinity groups focused on survival and mutual aid. In an increasingly unpredictable world, SurvivalHub serves as a critical tool for fostering collaboration, managing essential resources, and ensuring collective readiness for various emergencies. By combining a centralized Supply Hub with elements of Gamified Progression, SurvivalHub not only streamlines resource management but also engages and motivates users through interactive features.

Our vision for SurvivalHub is to create a secure, localized platform that emphasizes privacy, resilience, and user engagement. Whether hosted on a Raspberry Pi or interacted with via amateur radio, SurvivalHub is designed to function seamlessly in low-connectivity environments, ensuring that preparedness remains uninterrupted regardless of external circumstances.

## **Project Goals**

SurvivalHub aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Facilitate Group Formation:** Enable users to create and join private, trusted groups focused on mutual aid and preparedness.
2. **Manage Essential Supplies:** Provide a comprehensive catalog of survival tools and supplies, categorized by skill sets.
3. **Assign and Track Roles:** Use skill evaluations to assign appropriate roles within the group, ensuring all necessary areas are covered.
4. **Monitor Preparedness:** Offer dashboards and progress tracking to visualize group readiness and identify gaps.
5. **Ensure Security and Privacy:** Implement robust encryption and secure data handling to protect group information.
6. **Operate Offline:** Ensure functionality in low-connectivity environments through local hosting and manual data exchange options.

## **Development Phases and Key Features**
