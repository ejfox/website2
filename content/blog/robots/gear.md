There's a specific elegance that emerges when systems are forced to optimize under strict constraints. When everything must be weatherproof at highway speeds, when total capacity is limited to what a Versys X 300 can carry, when items must be both accessible and secure, when creative tools need to coexist with survival gear - traditional optimization strategies break down.

The system currently manifests across three primary containers:

- 5.11 Rush 24 (128oz base)
- WLF Enduro Pack (70.5oz base)
- Timbuk2 Waist Pack (70.5oz loaded)

![Gear System](https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1731960044/gear-viz.r1.png)

Each container operates as part of a larger capability web. The sleep system breaks down to fit a 20L dry bag (94.17oz loaded). The electronics kit (12.7oz) carries everything from emergency cash to field recording gear. Even the art supplies (26.27oz) are weatherproofed and ready for deployment.

The constraints of motorcycle mobility force unnatural optimizations. You can't minimize weight without limit (↓0) - you need tools that work. You can't maximize capacity (↑∞) - everything must fit on the bike. You can't specialize - a journey requires diverse capabilities.

The system documented here evolved through necessity. At its core lies a scoring matrix that quantifies what most gear discussions can only approximate. Each item is evaluated across four axes:

- Time Criticality (how quickly you might need it)
- Consequence Severity (what happens if you don't have it)
- Weight/Space Penalty (what it costs to carry)
- Multi-Use Factor (how versatile it proves in practice)

This isn't theoretical. The scores emerge from actual use. These constraints created something unexpected: a better system than intentional design would have produced. This is an analysis of that system, how it evolved, and why it works for me.

Whether you ride or not, the principles here apply to anyone interested in maintaining multiple capabilities within strict constraints.

## Fox's Circle of Accessibility

A Framework for Equipment Classification and Storage Optimization

### Core Principles
1. Equipment should be stored at the furthest accessible tier that doesn't compromise its utility
2. Each tier move inward approximately doubles the importance of weight/space efficiency
3. Multi-use items may occupy different tiers based on primary function
4. Seasonal adjustments may shift items between tiers

### Scoring System

Rate each item on a scale of 1-5 in each category:

#### Time Criticality (T)
5. Immediate (< 5 minutes)
4. Very Soon (< 1 hour)
3. Same Day (< 24 hours)
2. This Week (< 7 days)
1. Eventually (> 7 days)

#### Consequence Severity (C)
5. Life-threatening if absent
4. Major health/safety impact
3. Significant discomfort/limitation
2. Notable inconvenience
1. Minor inconvenience

#### Weight/Space Penalty (W)
5. Negligible
4. Light/Small
3. Moderate
2. Heavy/Bulky
1. Very Heavy/Bulky

#### Multi-Use Factor (M)
5. Critical in 3+ scenarios
4. Important in 2+ scenarios
3. Critical in 1 scenario
2. Useful in multiple scenarios
1. Single specific use

### Tier Classification Formula

Total Score = (T × 2) + (C × 2) + (W × 1.5) + (M × 1)

#### Tier Placement
- Tier 1 (On-Person): 35-47.5 points
- Tier 2 (Vehicle/Pack): 25-34.5 points
- Tier 3 (Base Cache): < 25 points

### Tier Definitions

#### 🎯 TIER 1: ON-PERSON KIT

"The No-Question Layer"

- Must be immediately accessible
- Carried daily
- Critical for life/safety
- Extremely space/weight efficient

Example Analysis:

Storm10 Shell

- Time: 5 (immediate need possible)
- Consequence: 5 (hypothermia risk)
- Weight: 4 (light/packable)
- Multi-use: 5 (critical in multiple scenarios)
Score: (5×2) + (5×2) + (4×1.5) + (5×1) = 28.5
VERDICT: Tier 1

#### 🎒 TIER 2: VEHICLE/PACK KIT

"The Day-to-Week Layer"

- Accessible within 24 hours
- Carried on longer trips
- Enhances capability/comfort
- Moderate weight/space considerations

Example Analysis:

Sleep System

- Time: 3 (same-day need)
- Consequence: 4 (major comfort/safety)
- Weight: 2 (bulky)
- Multi-use: 4 (multiple scenarios)
Score: (3×2) + (4×2) + (2×1.5) + (4×1) = 21
VERDICT: Tier 2

#### 🏠 TIER 3: BASE CACHE

"The Extended Operation Layer"

- Accessible within 60 days
- Stored at fixed location
- Maintenance/long-term utility
- Weight/space less critical

Example Analysis:

Zipper Repair Kit

- Time: 1 (eventual need)
- Consequence: 2 (inconvenience)
- Weight: 4 (small)
- Multi-use: 2 (specific uses)
Score: (1×2) + (2×2) + (4×1.5) + (2×1) = 12
VERDICT: Tier 3

### Modifiers and Special Considerations

#### Season Modifier

Items may shift one tier inward during their primary season

Example: Heavy insulation layers move from Tier 2 to Tier 1 in winter

#### Critical Redundancy Rule

Backup versions of Tier 1 items should be stored in Tier 2

Example: Backup fire starter, spare shell layer

#### Bulk Supply Rule

Consumables should be distributed across tiers with quantity tapering inward
