EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS & SYSTEM GUIDANCE

CORE PRINCIPLES:

1. Stay dry at all costs
2. Prevent sweating during movement
3. Multiple backup heat sources
4. Know layer deployment order
5. Always pack Storm10 shell

EMERGENCY SCENARIOS:

1. WET GEAR
```
Priority Actions:
- Immediately deploy Storm10 shell
- Remove wet base layers
- Keep moving to generate heat
- Never sleep in wet gear

Recovery:
- Body heat dry method in bag
- Use mechanical wringing
- Alternate layers
```

2. STRANDED/STATIC
```
Immediate Actions:
- Deploy all layers
- Find wind protection
- Set up sleep system
- Maintain small movements
- Stay hydrated

Conservation Mode:
- Midlayer + Puffy + Shell
- Minimize sweat
- Small fuel sources
```

3. POWER LOSS
```
Sequence:
1. Switch to pure layering
2. Maximize passive insulation
3. Use exercise for heat
4. Keep extremities moving
```

4. CAUGHT IN STORM
```
Actions:
1. Shell layer deployment
2. Find immediate shelter
3. Prevent sweat buildup
4. Monitor extremities
5. Consider camp setup
```

CRITICAL WARNINGS:

- Never sleep in wet gear
- Don't let boots freeze
- Watch for overheating
- Monitor power levels
- Check fingers/toes regularly

LAYER DEPLOYMENT RULES:

1. ACTIVE
```
Cold Start Protocol:
- Start cold, warm up moving
- Add layers slowly
- Vent before sweating
```

2. STATIC
```
Layer Addition Order:
1. Base (HEATTECH)
3. North Face Hoody
4. Storm10 Shell
```

3. SLEEP
```
Setup Sequence:
1. Z-Lite down first
2. Inflate Quasar fully
3. Bag + liner ready
4. Dry layers staged
```

PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

1. ALWAYS CARRY
- Storm10 shell
- Extra base layer
- Power bank
- Emergency snack

2. ALWAYS KNOW
- Nearest shelter
- Backup routes
- Layer status
- Power levels

3. ALWAYS CHECK
- Weather forecast
- Gear condition
- Layer dryness
- Boot dryness

URBAN-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:

```
Building Access:
- Know 24hr locations
- Map heating grates
- Know covered areas
- Plan warm-up points

Transport Backup:
- Keep ride share apps
- Know subway locations
- Plan bail-out routes
```

MOTORCYCLE PROTOCOLS:

```
Highway Speed Rules:
- Full layer deployment
- Shell layer critical
- No exposed skin
- Pre-warm gear

Temp Limits:
- Below 30°F: Limited duration
- Below 20°F: Emergency only
- Below 15°F: Find alternate transport
```

DAILY CHECKS:

1. Weather forecast
2. Layer condition
3. Power levels
4. Backup gear
5. Route planning

MAINTENANCE PRIORITIES:

1. Keep shells clean/proofed
2. Maintain pad inflation
3. Store bag unstuffed
4. Dry gear completely
5. Charge power banks

RED FLAGS (SEEK SHELTER):
