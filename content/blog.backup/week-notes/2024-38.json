Went with this vision prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Describe this image in detail, breaking it down into the following aspects: 1) Main subject matter, 2) Visual elements like composition and setting, 3) Any visible technical content (such as code or devices) with a focus on the general purpose or functionality rather than specifics, and 4) Inferred context, such as time of day, season, or mood. Finally, generate 5-20 relevant tags based on the description, aiming to include tags like 'code,' 'photography,' 'art,' 'nature,' '3d,' or other relevant terms from a wide range of topics. Try to keep your description under 400 words. Avoid lists. At the end, make some inferences/guesses as to what the user is doing, if applicable. Keep your answer as information-dense and succinct as possible. Try to capture the overall gist of the image as well as the specifics. Never respond in the negative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"scrapbook-core\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#scrapbook-core\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Scrapbook-core</h3>\n<p>Working on getting this deployed to fly.io on a cronjob so I don't have to run it by hand, which means my bookmarks are almost always out of sync lately.</p>\n<h3 id=\"updated-blog\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#updated-blog\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Updated blog</h3>\n<p>I worked on creating <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/ejfox/333fa5fa676160b2e5757160a62f555c\">a custom markdown->json parser</a> I could use to power my blog, since the bug that's preventing me from running my blog with <code>@nuxt/content</code> hasn't been fixed yet and I am extremely impatient.</p>\n<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726593376/Screenshot_2024-09-17_at_1.16.03_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot - - \">\n<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726780671/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_5.17.38_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot - - \">\n<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726785675/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_6.41.01_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot - - \">\n<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726791978/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_8.26.03_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot - - \">\n<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/v1726927925/Screen_Recording_2024-09-21_at_10.10.50_AM.mov\" alt=\"Screenshot - - \">\n<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/v1726928052/Screen_Recording_2024-09-21_at_10.13.07_AM.mov\" alt=\"Screenshot - - \">\n<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/v1726929283/Screen_Recording_2024-09-21_at_10.34.19_AM.mov\" alt=\"Screenshot - - \">\n<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726930224/Screenshot_2024-09-21_at_10.50.01_AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot - - \">\n<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726930804/Screenshot_2024-09-21_at_10.59.52_AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot - - \">",
