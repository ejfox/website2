Cue existential sigh.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Repo Renaming Adventures</strong>: We pulled off a classic repo shuffle, renaming the ancient <code>website2</code> to <code>website2-archive</code> like it was a retired general, and then uploaded the new, shiny <code>website2</code> repo to GitHub like a phoenix rising from the ashes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Netlify Shuffle</strong>: Time to delete the old Netlify setup. Why? Because we’re not just keeping things simple here. We nuked the old Netlify deployment and set up a fresh one with the codename <code>warm-crostata-e31905</code>—delicious and mysterious.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>NPMRC Shenanigans</strong>: Enter the <code>.npmrc</code> problem—your work settings decided to sabotage the build, pulling packages from some cursed corporate registry like a rogue AI gone mad. This resulted in a critical failure mid-build, and frustration levels skyrocketed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Backup Your Backup’s Backup</strong>: After a moment of controlled rage, we backed up the <code>.npmrc</code> file like responsible coders and restored the “normal” one from <code>npmrc-normal-bak</code>. Why do we have all these backups? Only the code gods know.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Great Cache Purge</strong>: We hit <code>npm cache clean --force</code>, effectively giving npm the middle finger and telling it to start fresh, because if you're gonna fix npm problems, might as well go nuclear.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>\"Where the Hell is my Repo?\"</strong>: After all this meticulous cleaning, you tried to <code>cd</code> into the wrong directory—because, of course, your local <code>website2</code> repo has decided to play hide-and-seek. A quick mental facepalm, and then back on track.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Node Versioning Ritual</strong>: We prayed to the version gods, invoking the <code>.nvmrc</code> file to ensure Node v20.16.0 is active, like a secret spell whispered in a forgotten tongue.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Vanquishing Node Modules</strong>: With a battle cry, we nuked <code>node_modules</code>, that bloated directory of dependency hell, followed by removing the ghost of a <code>yarn.lock</code> that apparently never existed, but we tried twice anyway just for good measure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Yarn Rebirth</strong>: With our path cleared of wreckage, we summoned the powers of <code>yarn install</code> to begin the next chapter—installing fresh dependencies from the land of npmjs.org. Would it succeed? Only time (and another cup of coffee) would tell.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
