I just need a webhook when a new image is uploaded that sends it GPT4-vision and asks for a description, then update the Cloudinary asset</li>\n<li>I really need a better way of asset management within Obsidian. I don't want to be depending on the binary images in the folder, and basically I want to convert images to Cloudinary links as soon as possible and use Cloudinary as my lingua-franca for image/video/audio assets- but right now, things fall out of sync, and I think I need an Obsidian plugin to handle it for me</li>\n<li>Add a section to my website for music, beats, and audio experiments and creations</li>\n</ul>",
