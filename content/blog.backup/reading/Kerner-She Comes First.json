A woman’s orgasm is complex and often elusive, and many men are unable to control their penises with enough precision to properly guide a woman through the stages of arousal. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B000FC1PRK&#x26;location=500\">500</a> ^ref-33815</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In Taoist sex practices, a woman’s vaginal secretions are considered an essential part of her “yin” energy, a libation that should be savored in the pursuit of yin/yang harmony and is referred to as “moon flower.” — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B000FC1PRK&#x26;location=821\">821</a> ^ref-23957</p>\n<hr>\n<p>According to the teachings of Tantra, a woman’s upper lip is considered one of the most erogenous areas on her body because of a special nerve that connects it to the clitoris, and is said to channel erotic energy. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B000FC1PRK&#x26;location=1297\">1297</a> ^ref-14497</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Never, under any circumstances, blow into a woman’s vagina as though trying to fill it with air. Doing so is seriously dangerous. Blowing into a woman’s vagina may cause an embolism and lead to death. Breathe on her; blow lightly on her; never blow into her. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B000FC1PRK&#x26;location=1583\">1583</a> ^ref-64784</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As Kundera explains, the title, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, comes from a meditation on the philosophy of Nietzsche, who said that we should live every moment of our lives as though we were sentenced to repeat it over and over, forever and ever, for all eternity. We should live each moment as though we were creating an eternal, unchangeable work of art. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B000FC1PRK&#x26;location=2692\">2692</a> ^ref-38364</p>\n<hr>",
