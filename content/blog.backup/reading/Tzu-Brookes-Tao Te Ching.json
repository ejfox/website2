He practices a wordless doctrine. Good and bad come to him and he refuses neither. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B009WA8ZKG&#x26;location=112\">112</a> ^ref-40490</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The wise person acts but does not take credit. Leads, but does not rule. This is a profound virtue. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B009WA8ZKG&#x26;location=197\">197</a> ^ref-65476</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A bowl is useful because it is molded around emptiness, waiting to be filled. A house is useful because of its doors and windows, that allow people to enter and live happily. Therefore the 'what is' is benefited by the 'what is not'. Each is served by the other. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B009WA8ZKG&#x26;location=204\">204</a> ^ref-5329</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The wise person is excellent at helping others, and does not reject any of them. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B009WA8ZKG&#x26;location=417\">417</a> ^ref-11567</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Although the Tao seems insignificant, no one can command it. The leader that can act in accordance with it will find that everything is naturally in accord with him. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B009WA8ZKG&#x26;location=482\">482</a> ^ref-24629</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One who is well planted in the Tao cannot be uprooted, one who has a firm grasp of the Tao will not let it slip away. Your descendants will not cease in their honour of you. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B009WA8ZKG&#x26;location=743\">743</a> ^ref-11602</p>\n<hr>",
