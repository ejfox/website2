Mission accomplished: I could never tell how much genuine feeling there was in her brilliant performance, and yet I still have quite specific sense-memories of these events, which occurred more than thirty years ago. Humankind cannot bear very much reality. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B01G0GD0WC&#x26;location=1788\">1788</a> ^ref-61520</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The arrogance implied in believing that one’s beauty can afford to be concealed is entrancing. By contrast, people not wearing glasses sometimes seem preposterously accessible, uncomplicated, unmysterious, trampy. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B01G0GD0WC&#x26;location=1964\">1964</a> ^ref-1524</p>\n<hr>",
