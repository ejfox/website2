Many interconnections are flows of information—signals that go to decision points or action points within a system. These kinds of interconnections are often harder to see, but the system reveals them to those who look. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B005VSRFEA&#x26;location=354\">354</a> ^ref-37714</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Systems can be nested within systems. Therefore, there can be purposes within purposes. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B005VSRFEA&#x26;location=385\">385</a> ^ref-49361</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Stocks change over time through the actions of a flow. Flows are filling and draining, births and deaths, purchases and sales, growth and decay, deposits and withdrawals, successes and failures. A stock, then, is the present memory of the history of changing flows within the system. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B005VSRFEA&#x26;location=432\">432</a> ^ref-26028</p>\n<hr>\n<p>You’ll be thinking not in terms of a static world, but a dynamic one. You’ll stop looking for who’s to blame; instead you’ll start asking, “What’s the system?” The concept of feedback opens up the idea that a system can cause its own behavior. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B005VSRFEA&#x26;location=695\">695</a> ^ref-24283</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There’s an important general principle here, and also one specific to the thermostat structure. First the general one: The information delivered by a feedback loop can only affect future behavior; it can’t deliver the information, and so can’t have an impact fast enough to correct behavior that drove the current feedback. A person in the system who makes a decision based on the feedback can’t change the behavior of the system that drove the current feedback; the decisions he or she makes will affect only future behavior. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B005VSRFEA&#x26;location=770\">770</a> ^ref-26576</p>\n<hr>",
