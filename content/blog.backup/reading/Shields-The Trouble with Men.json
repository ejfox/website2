I’ve always let it come to me, which of course is a rather passive approach to existence, but the funny thing is: inevitably, it comes. Sooner or later, whether I wanted it or not, the world came to me; it came at me, it keeps coming at me. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07MT424DM&#x26;location=604\">604</a> ^ref-15080</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Girls with asses like mine do not talk to boys with faces like yours.

It would be like having her say, ‘I know. I’m breathing, too.’” [Linker] — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07MT424DM&#x26;location=1142\">1142</a> ^ref-21482</p>\n<hr>\n<p>While women today think the ’90s was when the look became popular, the first Playboy centerfold featuring a shaved vagina didn’t take place until about 2002. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07MT424DM&#x26;location=1326\">1326</a> ^ref-35336</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There is one woman whom fate has destined for each of us; if we miss her, we are saved. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07MT424DM&#x26;location=1485\">1485</a> ^ref-404</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The love that lasts the longest is the love that is never returned. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07MT424DM&#x26;location=1486\">1486</a> ^ref-11707</p>\n<hr>",
