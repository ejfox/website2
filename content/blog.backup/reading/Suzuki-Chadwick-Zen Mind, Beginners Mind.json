If you keep your original mind, the precepts will keep themselves. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=273\">273</a> ^ref-45458</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The teaching which is written on paper is not the true teaching. Written teaching is a kind of food for your brain. Of course it is necessary to take some food for your brain, but it is more important to be yourself by practicing the right way of life. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=334\">334</a> ^ref-8599</p>\n<hr>\n<p>You should not be absent-minded. But to be aware of the movement does not mean to be aware of your small self, but rather of your universal nature, or Buddha nature. This kind of awareness is very important, — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=351\">351</a> ^ref-63839</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The only effort that will help you is to count your breathing, or to concentrate on your inhaling and exhaling. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=401\">401</a> ^ref-34329</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We say, “A good father is not a good father.” Do you understand? One who thinks he is a good father is not a good father; one who thinks he is a good husband is not a good husband. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=496\">496</a> ^ref-10139</p>\n<hr>\n<p>At first you will have various problems, and it is necessary for you to make some effort to continue our practice. For the beginner, practice without effort is not true practice. For the beginner, the practice needs great effort. Especially for young people, it is necessary to try very hard to achieve something. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=545\">545</a> ^ref-64592</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After you have practiced for a while, you will realize that it is not possible to make rapid, extraordinary progress. Even though you try very hard, the progress you make is always little by little. It is not like going out in a shower in which you know when you get wet. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=591\">591</a> ^ref-28678</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We ourselves cannot put any magic spells on this world. The world is its own magic. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=758\">758</a> ^ref-36733</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There is a saying, “To catch two birds with one stone.” That is what people usually try to do. Because they want to catch too many birds they find it difficult to be concentrated on one activity, and they may end up not catching any birds at all! — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=775\">775</a> ^ref-9742</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Repeating his recollections in this way, his personality will be twisted more and more, until he becomes quite a disagreeable, stubborn fellow. This is an example of leaving a trace of one’s thinking. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=787\">787</a> ^ref-16169</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It is necessary to remember what we have done, but we should not become attached to what we have done in some special sense. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=789\">789</a> ^ref-25839</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In order not to leave any traces, when you do something, you should do it with your whole body and mind; you should be concentrated on what you do. You should do it completely, like a good bonfire. You should not be a smoky fire. You should burn yourself completely. If you do not burn yourself completely, a trace of yourself will be left in what you do. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=790\">790</a> ^ref-7172</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you practice zazen with your whole body and mind, even for a moment, that is zazen. So moment after moment you should devote yourself to your practice. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=797\">797</a> ^ref-43190</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Usually everyone forgets about zazen. Everyone forgets about God. They work very hard at the second and third kinds of creation, but God does not help the activity. How is it possible for Him to help when He does not realize who He is? — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=850\">850</a> ^ref-62163</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Of course, to live is to create problems. If we did not appear in this world, our parents would have no difficulty with us! Just by appearing we create problems for them. This is all right. Everything creates some problems. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=854\">854</a> ^ref-63829</p>\n<hr>\n<p>And we should do something new. To do something new, of course we must know our past, and this is all right. But we should not keep holding on to anything we have done; we should only reflect on it. And we must have some idea of what we should do in the future. But the future is the future, the past is the past; now we should work on something new. This is our attitude, and how we should live in this world. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=860\">860</a> ^ref-21793</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Even in wrong practice, when you realize it and continue, there is right practice. Our practice cannot be perfect, but without being discouraged by this, we should continue it. This is the secret of practice. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=901\">901</a> ^ref-17677</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The way to practice without having any goal is to limit your activity, or to be concentrated on what you are doing in this moment. Instead of having some particular object in mind, you should limit your activity. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=923\">923</a> ^ref-23605</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When you bow, you should just bow; when you sit, you should just sit; when you eat, you should just eat. If you do this, the universal nature is there. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=929\">929</a> ^ref-3731</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I think some of you who practice zazen here may believe in some other religion, but I do not mind. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=932\">932</a> ^ref-2392</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The purpose of studying Buddhism is not to study Buddhism, but to study ourselves. It is impossible to study ourselves without some teaching. If you want to know what water is you need science, and the scientist needs a laboratory. In the laboratory there are various ways in which to study what water is. Thus it is possible to know what kind of elements water has, the various forms it takes, and its nature. But it is impossible thereby to know water in — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=942\">942</a> ^ref-28465</p>\n<hr>\n<p>itself. It is the same thing with us. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=945\">945</a> ^ref-5934</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So to find the meaning of your life in the zendo is to find the meaning of your everyday activity. To be aware of the meaning of your life, you practice zazen. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=961\">961</a> ^ref-51296</p>\n<hr>",
