And how many women had actually died as a result? Nobody was counting. A 2014 United Nations report, coauthored by SisterSong, described the state of data collection on maternal mortality in the United States as “particularly weak.” — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B08BT3SY5N&#x26;location=538\">538</a> ^ref-24631</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The chief of the CDC’s Maternal and Infant Health branch, William Callaghan, makes the significance of this “embarrassing” data more clear: “What we choose to measure is a statement of what we value in health,” he explains.7 We might edit his statement to add that it’s a measure of who we value in health, too.8 — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B08BT3SY5N&#x26;location=547\">547</a> ^ref-53282</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Examining power means naming and explaining the forces of oppression that are so baked into our daily lives—and into our datasets, our databases, and our algorithms—that we often don’t even see them. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B08BT3SY5N&#x26;location=568\">568</a> ^ref-1470</p>\n<hr>",
