When we succeed in this, the ego loses layers of its absorption in the fiction of separation, and comes more and more to see itself as just a particular (rather funny) expression of a much larger divine whole, the Self. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=554\">554</a> ^ref-5315</p>\n<hr>\n<p>To cast a spell is to communicate with your personal unconscious and the collective unconscious in a way that generates specific results through synchronicity. Believe it or not, you are casting spells at every single moment. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=573\">573</a> ^ref-42643</p>\n<hr>\n<p>And since your performance of your identity entails a perpetual communication with your unconscious and the collective unconscious, you perpetually generate circumstances, relationships, and synchronicities that mirror and affirm and elaborate your identification. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=578\">578</a> ^ref-40023</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In the process of Existential Kink you invite your spirit to have the realization that your life on earth—right now, right here, in this animal, human body—is actually exactly what it has always wanted to celebrate with its exultant songs of perfection. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=630\">630</a> ^ref-48254</p>\n<hr>\n<p>John Milton observed in Paradise Lost, “The mind is its own place and in itself, can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.” — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=724\">724</a> ^ref-15567</p>\n<hr>\n<p>All we need to do is shift the context in our imagination from one of “awful thing happening to me against my will” to “kinky fun thing happening that I fully consent to.” Get off on this thing, this situation, this feeling that your ego thinks that you hate. Feel the freedom of that, the liberation of it. Allow yourself to be touched by the magnetism and electric spark of the “awful” thing that's present. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=971\">971</a> ^ref-62128</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Any time I'm anxious about something, I'm actually tenderly caressing the possibility of it, pushing on it with my tongue like it's a loose tooth, savoring the little jolts of misery it gives. Like “Ooooooh, what if I somehow forget something totally important and then I just FAIL and everyone, the whole internet, just hates me, for good reason, because I completely suck… .” — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=998\">998</a> ^ref-47051</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We get stuck when we look for “reasons” to motivate us to action, because some part of us knows that there simply is no “reason.” — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=1310\">1310</a> ^ref-52931</p>\n<hr>\n<p>People have various sorts of havingness level or “upper limit” imprints based on their karma and their childhood experiences. Some folks, for example, are willing to feel highly valued with money but are totally unwilling to be highly valued with love, or vice versa. Other folks are massively uncomfortable with all kinds of “being valued” sensations. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=1601\">1601</a> ^ref-51587</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Is it possible that these judgments, complaints, criticisms, resentments are meaningless mechanisms whose sole purpose is to help me avoid feeling tremendously good, loved, valued, inspired?” — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=1789\">1789</a> ^ref-52321</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I'm saying: Adopt an aesthetic rather than a moral attitude to your feeling states. In doing this, you practice being the artist of your life rather than the judge of it. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=1874\">1874</a> ^ref-32181</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Feeling wildly offended at the slightest slight (A way to cover up awareness of masochistic desire to receive insult) Feeling tremendously guilty when you've disappointed someone (A way to cover up awareness of sadistic desire to inflict pain) Feeling very anxious in social situations (A way to cover up feelings of budding connection and intimacy, and also vicious aggression—usually both) — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=1898\">1898</a> ^ref-55929</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The thing about the ego is that it needs a sense of opposition, of refusal, of rejection in order to maintain itself. It has to say: “No! That is awful! I don't like that! No, that's not me!” to something in order to define itself as separate from the undulating whole of the weird fractal hologram of life. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=1916\">1916</a> ^ref-54224</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When you perceive life as a comedy, you receive rich infusions of energy that give you the strength to move mountains. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=1957\">1957</a> ^ref-21697</p>\n<hr>",
