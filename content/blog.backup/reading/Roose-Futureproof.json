Daugherty and H. James Wilson, two executives at the consulting firm Accenture, write in their book Human + Machine that human-AI collaborations will be a cornerstone of the twenty-first-century economy. “AI systems are not wholesale replacing us,” they write. “Rather, they are amplifying our skills and collaborating with us to achieve productivity gains that have previously not been possible.” — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07ZN3TDWH&#x26;location=398\">398</a> ^ref-7964</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Accenture, the consulting firm, surveyed one thousand large corporations in 2018 and found that AI-related jobs were being created in three categories, which they called “trainers, explainers, and sustainers.” These are the people who help guide and oversee machines, explain the decisions made by algorithms to other humans, and do the messy work of integrating AI into corporate IT departments. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07ZN3TDWH&#x26;location=540\">540</a> ^ref-38695</p>\n<hr>",
