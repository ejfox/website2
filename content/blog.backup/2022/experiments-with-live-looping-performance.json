It has been used for many years by a variety of different artists and it has been used on stage and in recording studios.</p>\n<p>This article aims to introduce the reader to the techniques used in live looping and to describe what a live looping performer needs to know in order to do perform effectively.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To program a drumbeat is to align an external rhythmic device to an individualâ€™s biorhythm.\nSaul Williams <a href=\"Williams-The%20Dead%20Emcee%20Scrolls.md\">Williams-The Dead Emcee Scrolls</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also [[generative-music-iteration]]</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/trFeqgcHQ6A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h3 id=\"fundamentals-of-looping\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#fundamentals-of-looping\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Fundamentals of Looping</h3>\n<p>You must place the fundamentals of rhythm at the heart of your rig, because those are the sounds that will make people move.</p>\n<p>Focus on getting a beat or simple riff looping, and once that is done, start putting a little seasoning onto the beat.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to spice up your basic rhythm, but one thing is undeniable: It should act as a strong foundation for the rest of your mix.</p>\n<p>Now, you can always add a dash of sugar. Sugar comes in many forms: A catchy melody in your main synth line, an uplifting chord progression using synths or a well placed vocal breakbeat.</p>\n<p>Keep building, and then remove some elements, build some tension, and then suddenly drop all of the elements back. Now do it all over again.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w6lgz35LJTk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h3 id=\"artists-who-live-loop\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#artists-who-live-loop\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Artists who live loop</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Animal Collective</li>\n<li>Marc Rebillet</li>\n<li>Reggie Watts</li>\n<li>Imogen Heap</li>\n<li>Beardyman</li>\n<li>Jacob Collier</li>\n<li>Andrew Bird</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"core-principles\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#core-principles\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Core principles</h3>\n<h4 id=\"tempo-sync\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#tempo-sync\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Tempo sync</h4>\n<p>To get a satisfying flow while performing live loops, the loops in the rig have to be at the same tempo. This is a complex task, because it involves connecting some gear using MIDI, while other gear doesn't even have a MIDI in.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the TR-8, SP-555, and RC-505 have a \"sync\" function, which can be used to send a synth and MIDI clock to other devices. This means that if the TR-8 is playing a consistent beat, the rest of the gear can receive that beat and use it to start automatically looping and recording their tracks. I usually have my RC-505 as master and have the TR-8 sync to whatever tempo it is set at.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dynamics--crescendos\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#dynamics--crescendos\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Dynamics &#x26; crescendos</h4>\n<p>It's important to leave enough space in a performance to build up from a quiet side to a peak. This is done by adding and removing loops from the mix and fading their volume in and out.</p>\n<h4 id=\"looping\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#looping\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Looping</h4>\n<p>When there are too many loops happening at the same time, the performance becomes oversaturated and loses it's dynamics.</p>\n<p>A small correction in tempo to correct a mistake will sound very abrupt and will ruin the performance.</p>\n<p>The only way out is good preparation: be careful when you play, and know your gear really well.</p>\n<p>If you choose the right amount of loops to perform with, it will be much easier to keep track of what's going on.</p>\n<p>When performing with a number of different devices, there will be some degree of randomness to your loops, and riding the natural drift is part of the art of performing live.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n0VJ9kbxn5Y\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h3 id=\"live-looping-pitfalls\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#live-looping-pitfalls\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Live Looping Pitfalls</h3>\n<h4 id=\"too-repetitive\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#too-repetitive\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Too Repetitive</h4>\n<p>If you play the same loop over and over again, the performance will become boring.</p>\n<p>The solution is to add new loops to the mix, and to remove old loops. There should almost always be <em>something</em> changing at any point in time.</p>\n<h4 id=\"losing-sync\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#losing-sync\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Losing sync</h4>\n<p>If the loops are not in sync, the performance will sound bad.</p>\n<p>The solution is to use the sync function on the TR-8, SP-555, and RC-505.</p>\n<h4 id=\"not-making-changes-on-beat\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#not-making-changes-on-beat\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Not making changes on-beat</h4>\n<p>Every change that you make, whether you think it will affect the sound or not, should be made on-beat. That way even if it has unintended effects, it at least happened in the right place and can sound a lot better.</p>\n<h4 id=\"not-enough-inputssounds\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#not-enough-inputssounds\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Not enough inputs/sounds</h4>\n<p>If there are not enough loops in the mix, the performance will sound empty.</p>\n<p>If there are not enough sounds, it gets boring quickly. Having a library of diverse instruments available keeps things sounding fresh.</p>\n<h3 id=\"equipment\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#equipment\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Equipment</h3>\n<h4 id=\"roland-tr-8-drums\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#roland-tr-8-drums\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Roland TR-8 (Drums)</h4>\n<p>The TR-8 is a drum machine and sequencing interface that emulates the sound and feel of the classic TR-808 and TR-909. It can be used for triggered live samples or as a percussion instrument in a live setting.</p>\n<p>The TR-8 is great because you get individual control over the volume and timbre of each drum, so you can easily add or remove just the hi-hats or snare at any time.</p>\n<h4 id=\"xone-96-mixer\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#xone-96-mixer\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Xone 96 (Mixer)</h4>\n<p>The Xone 96 is a DJ mixer with loads of inputs and fx, but where it shines is as the center for audio controls for all inputs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"delay-and-reverb-pedals-effects\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#delay-and-reverb-pedals-effects\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Delay and reverb pedals (effects)</h4>\n<p>At least one delay and one reverb pedal on loop make any performance infinitely better. The DD-7 and DD-3 have different delay times and sound, so they make a great pair in my opinion.</p>\n<h4 id=\"traktor-f1-sampler\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#traktor-f1-sampler\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Traktor F1 (Sampler)</h4>\n<p>The F1 is NI's controller for the Traktor DJ software. It's a limited sampler with 4 slots, but it's useful in a live looping setup due to it's ease of use during a performance.</p>\n<p>In the context of live looping rhythm, the knobs correspond to decay, filter cutoff and other performance oriented controls.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sp-555-fx\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#sp-555-fx\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>SP-555 (FX)</h4>\n<p>In my opinion, the SP-555 is the definitive looping sample player. It's a classic, the one where it all started. It's somewhat confusing interface is eclipsed by its usefulness as a looping tool. The library of loops and samples available for these devices is second to none, and so are their warm saturating sounds.</p>\n<h4 id=\"midifighter-controller\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#midifighter-controller\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Midifighter (Controller)</h4>\n<p>The Midifighter is a controller that is designed to perform samples in a live setting. It's small, it's sturdy, and it's easy to use.</p>\n<h4 id=\"keylab-49-controller\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#keylab-49-controller\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Keylab 49 (Controller)</h4>\n<p>The Keylab 49 is a MIDI controller with 49 keys, a pitch bend wheel, a modulation wheel, and a bunch of knobs and buttons.</p>\n<h4 id=\"turntables-controller\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#turntables-controller\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Turntables (Controller)</h4>\n<p>The turntables are the classic DJ tool. They are used to control the pitch of a record, and they can be used to scratch.</p>\n<h4 id=\"rc-505-controller\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#rc-505-controller\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>RC-505 (Controller)</h4>\n<p>The RC-505 is a looping controller. It has 5 tracks, each with a fader and a knob. It also has a bunch of effects and a built in sampler.</p>",
