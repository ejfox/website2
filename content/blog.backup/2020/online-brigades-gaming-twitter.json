A screenshot of her suspension was later posted to the Telegram channel accompanied by the text “Great job! Let’s keep this shit up!”</p>\n<p>Even in cases where mass-reporting was unable to trigger automated or semi-automated systems within Twitter to suspend the targeted accounts, the barrage of attention and abuse from the organized trolls had the desired effect.</p>\n<p>One post from the group celebrates a target deleting their own post: “Good work all around boys, we are calling it off now. The leftist in question has removed his post attacking our brothers business due to being corrected by all of you.”</p>\n<p>Activists have responded with criticism of Twitter, with one user tweeting “The message from Twitter is clear: If a group of violent white supremacists mobilizes to silence journalists for exposing their allies' identities, they will comply with the wishes of the violent white supremacists.”</p>",
