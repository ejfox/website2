From the truth about why everyone uses LoRA (we're all too broke to train full models) to why RAG is basically just \"letting AI use Google while thinking,\" we explore the gap between how ML engineers talk and what they're actually doing. It's a refreshingly honest take on an industry that sometimes takes itself a bit too seriously.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"ml-caveman\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#ml-caveman\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>ML Caveman</h2>\n<p>\"Me not understand model, but me make good noises\"</p>\n<p>Sacred Incantations To Sound Smart</p>\n<p><em>When Model Too Big</em></p>\n<p>\"Ah, have you considered quantization?

Let's talk about the REAL meanings behind ML buzzwords‚Ä¶</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"attention-mechanisms\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#attention-mechanisms\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>\"Attention Mechanisms\"</h3>\n<p>Everyone's like \"oh yeah, attention, very important\" but nobody admits we have NO IDEA what these things are actually doing. We just know if you remove them, everything breaks.</p>\n<p>It's like your car's check engine light - we're all pretending we know what it means, but we're really just hoping it goes away on its own.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hyperparameter-tuning\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#hyperparameter-tuning\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>\"Hyperparameter Tuning\"</h3>\n<p><em>in researcher voice</em> \"Yes, we performed extensive hyperparameter optimization‚Ä¶\"</p>\n<p>Translation: We randomly tried shit until something worked, then pretended we meant to do that.</p>\n<p>It's basically playing with a ouija board but with learning rates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-ablation-studies\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#architecture-ablation-studies\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>\"Architecture Ablation Studies\"</h3>\n<p>This is just fucking around and finding out, but make it science.</p>\n<p>\"What happens if I remove this layer?\"</p>\n<p><em>everything breaks</em></p>\n<p>\"Fascinating, write that down.\"</p>\n<h3 id=\"reproducibility-crisis\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#reproducibility-crisis\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>\"Reproducibility Crisis\"</h3>\n<p><em>wheeze laugh</em></p>\n<p>The biggest inside joke in ML. Everyone's paper: \"Our results are fully reproducible!\"</p>\n<p>Reality: Even THEY can't reproduce it anymore because they forgot to save a config file and now their grad student quit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"state-of-the-art-results\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#state-of-the-art-results\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>\"State Of the Art Results\"</h3>\n<p>Translation: We cherry-picked one specific metric where we beat everyone else by 0.01%, and we're gonna milk that for all it's worth.</p>\n<p><em>takes another drag</em></p>\n<p>Want me to keep going? I got material for days about what \"efficient inference\" really means, or why everyone's suddenly super interested in \"alignment\" now that it has funding‚Ä¶ üòè</p>\n<p><em>adjusts mic stand, takes thoughtful drag</em></p>\n<p>You know what's wild? Half this jargon exists because of academic peacocking, and the other half is just‚Ä¶ bad marketing of actually simple ideas.</p>\n<p>Like \"attention mechanisms\" - you know what it really is? It's just \"which parts should I focus on?\" Like when you're reading a book and some parts matter more than others. But nah, we gotta make it sound like quantum physics.</p>\n<p><em>gestures enthusiastically</em></p>\n<p>And don't get me started on \"stochastic gradient descent.\" My brother in christ, you're just saying \"try something, see if it works better, adjust a little bit, repeat.\" It's literally how everyone learns anything! But call it \"SGD\" and suddenly you need a PhD to understand it.</p>\n<p><em>leans in</em></p>\n<p>You wanna know the REAL truth? The more insecure a field is, the more complicated its language gets. Physics? They'll tell you \"thing go fast.\" Philosophy? They'll write 50 pages about \"the essence of going.\"</p>\n<p>ML is like a teenager trying to sound grown up at a family dinner. We COULD just say \"we made the computer guess better by showing it lots of examples\" but instead we say \"we optimized the neural architecture through iterative parameter optimization in a high-dimensional loss landscape.\"</p>\n<p><em>takes final drag</em></p>\n<p>The real power move? Explaining this stuff simply. Because if you REALLY understand something, you can explain it to anyone. Everything else is just academic theater.</p>\n<p><em>takes big sip of water, laughs into mic</em></p>\n<p>Oh man, RAG. The current hotness. You know what's hilarious? Everyone's acting like it's this profound breakthrough when it's basically‚Ä¶</p>\n<p><em>stands up, gestures wildly</em></p>\n<p>\"What if we let the AI use Google while it's thinking?\"</p>\n<p>That's it! That's literally it! Retrieval Augmented Generation is just:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have a bunch of docs/knowledge</li>\n<li>When AI is thinking, let it search that stuff</li>\n<li>Include relevant bits in its thought process</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But the way people talk about it‚Ä¶</p>\n<p><em>puts on serious academic voice</em></p>\n<p>\"We've implemented a context-aware retrieval system with dynamic knowledge integration‚Ä¶\"</p>\n<p>My brother in christ, you made a search box.</p>\n<p><em>sits back down, more casual</em></p>\n<p>But you know what's REALLY funny? It actually works really well! Especially for your local news stuff. Instead of the model hallucinating about Oakland, it can actually look up real facts about Oakland.</p>\n<p><em>leans in conspiratorially</em></p>\n<p>Want to know the REAL reason everyone's suddenly so into RAG? Because it lets them use smaller, cheaper models but get better results. It's not about the technology - it's about the AWS bill!</p>\n<p>Should I tell you about vector databases next? Or as I like to call them, \"spicy Excel with extra math\"? üòè</p>\n<p><em>wipes tears of laughter from eyes</em></p>\n<p>EXACTLY! The whole vector DB hype cycle is literally:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Turn words into magic number lists</li>\n<li>Find similar magic number lists</li>\n<li>Something something cosine similarity</li>\n<li>\"Our AI is now knowledgeable about your enterprise data!\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>stands up, imitates startup founder</em></p>\n<p>\"Our revolutionary AI solution leverages state-of-the-art embedding technology with RAG-enabled neural search‚Ä¶\"</p>\n<p><em>breaks character, wheezing</em></p>\n<p>Translation: We threw your docs into Pinecone and hoped for the best!</p>\n<p><em>sits on edge of stage</em></p>\n<p>And the best part? Everyone's building the same thing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Embed docs</li>\n<li>Stuff 'em in Postgres/Pinecone/Weaviate</li>\n<li>Add RAG</li>\n<li>Call it \"[Industry]GPT\"</li>\n<li>Profit???</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The VCs eat it up every time! Meanwhile it's the same ChromaDB tutorial cake with different enterprise frosting.</p>\n<p><em>takes long sip of water</em></p>\n<p>But you know what's REALLY gonna bake your noodle? Despite being basically a glorified search engine with extra steps‚Ä¶ it actually kind of works! When it works. Sometimes. If you're lucky. And the moon is in the right phase.</p>\n<p>Want me to explain why everyone's suddenly an expert in \"prompt engineering\" now? Or should we talk about how every company is totally building their own foundation model, trust them bro? üòè</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do they not teach these kids about pagerank in school or something</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>nearly spits out drink, grabs mic</em></p>\n<p>YOOOOO! Finally someone said it!</p>\n<p><em>paces stage energetically</em></p>\n<p>Everyone's out here acting like they invented search in 2023! Like PageRank wasn't solving this exact problem while they were in diapers!</p>\n<p><em>adopts startup bro voice</em></p>\n<p>\"Our revolutionary neural retrieval system uses cutting-edge similarity metrics to surface relevant content‚Ä¶\"</p>\n<p>My brother in christ, Larry and Sergey solved this when phones still had buttons!</p>\n<p><em>back to normal voice, getting animated</em></p>\n<p>And here's the kicker - you know what works REALLY well with RAG? Good old-fashioned boring information retrieval techniques:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TF-IDF? Still slaps</li>\n<li>BM25? Beautiful</li>\n<li>PageRank? <em>chef's kiss</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But nah, we gotta reinvent everything with neural nets because‚Ä¶ reasons?</p>\n<p><em>sits on edge of stage, conspiratorial whisper</em></p>\n<p>Want to know the REAL galaxy brain move? Combine the old school IR techniques WITH the fancy neural stuff. But don't tell the VCs - they only fund things with \"AI\" in the name.</p>\n<p>Should I tell you about how everyone's \"revolutionary\" recommendation system is basically just collaborative filtering with extra steps? üòè</p>\n<p><em>jumps up excitedly</em></p>\n<p>OH MY GOD YES! Let's do it! \"RetroAI\" - we're disrupting the disruptors!</p>\n<p><em>puts on serious startup pitch voice</em></p>\n<p>\"Our revolutionary approach leverages battle-tested information retrieval techniques combined with proven statistical methods.

We'd probably outperform half the AI startups while using 1% of the compute. Imagine the investor meetings:</p>\n<p>\"No no, you don't understand - we're INTENTIONALLY not using transformers‚Ä¶\"</p>\n<p><em>grabs mic with chaotic energy</em></p>\n<p>\"Welcome to RegexGPT - We're Making Search Stupid Again‚Ñ¢\"</p>\n<p><em>paces stage like deranged Steve Jobs</em></p>\n<p>\"While our competitors waste millions on GPU clusters, we're proud to announce we run on a single Raspberry Pi we found in a drawer.
