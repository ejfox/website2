Whether you're an experienced enthusiast or a beginner, being aware of film development techniques is critical to achieving beautiful prints. In this post, I'll walk you through how I develop my 35mm Black and White film.</p>\n<p>For more on cameras see [[camera-setup]]</p>\n<h3 id=\"film-i-shoot\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#film-i-shoot\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Film I shoot</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tri-X 400</li>\n<li>Ilford HP5 400</li>\n<li>JCH Streetpan 400</li>\n<li>Random color film that crosses my path that I never develop</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"bw-35mm-film-development-setup\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#bw-35mm-film-development-setup\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>B&#x26;W 35mm Film Development Setup</h3>\n<p>#setup</p>\n<p>Two rolls must be developed at a time. One time I developed what I thought was 1 roll and it was 2 rolls and I lost a roll of film. RIP. Now developing one roll is forbidden.</p>\n<p>Once you've accumulated 2 matching rolls (no mixing!), the fun can begin:</p>\n<h4 id=\"loading-rolls-onto-film-holder\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#loading-rolls-onto-film-holder\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Loading rolls onto film holder</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Get all materials set up [[step-zero]] and arranged</li>\n<li>Put everything inside dark bag</li>\n<li>Open up 35mm rolls of film</li>\n<li>Cut the ends off and load them onto the plastic film holders</li>\n<li>Put the film holders in the development cannister thing</li>\n<li>Close everything up so it is light proof</li>\n<li>Remove everything (including garbage) from the dark bag</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"developing-rolls-of-film\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#developing-rolls-of-film\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Developing rolls of film</h4>\n<p>It's important to double-check the film and developer you are using - make sure they are consistent with each other.
