Moreover, its widespread adoption ensures compatibility with various platforms and tools, making it a true lingua franca for digital writing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"great-plugin-framework-and-community\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#great-plugin-framework-and-community\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Great plugin framework and community</h3>\n<p>One of the most exciting aspects of Obsidian is its thriving plugin community.
