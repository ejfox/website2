It’s a concept from cooking that describes advanced preparation for a meal. You cut your onions and carrots beforehand and keep them in an accessible place. You gather all the spices you will need. You make your sauces.</p>\n<p>You’re still not making the meal- you’re doing everything but. You are preparing for the optimal moment. When your friends (or customers) arrive you assemble the dish. Everything is ready.</p>\n<p>With the right preparation it is much easier to enter a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)\">flow state</a> where everything just comes together. It can be beautiful to experience, even as a spectator. I spend a lot of time searching out different creative ways of <a href=\"https://www.are.na/block/4446495\">reaching</a> that state.</p>\n<p>You aren’t worried about where the salt is (it’s placed perfectly within arm’s reach). That would pull you out of your flow.</p>\n<p>When talking to friends about ideas or projects, I often find myself saying some version of “well the step zero for that is…” by which I mean, the task(s) that precede the actual task.<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1</a></sup> All the work that comes before even beginning.</p>\n<p>With the right <a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/the-state-of-hacktivism-in-2020-/d/d-id/1338382\">preparation</a> not only can you accomplish the task better, but you can enjoy yourself more as you do it.</p>\n<section data-footnotes class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"footnote-label\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#footnote-label\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-1\">\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s664NsLeFM\">Carl Sagan said</a> “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.” <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 1\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>",
