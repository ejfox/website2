# Resolution Criteria

This prediction resolves **TRUE** if a federal court issues findings of fact meeting ALL criteria:

1. **Federal Court**: US District Court, Circuit Court of Appeals, or Supreme Court
2. **Official Finding**: Published ruling, order, or judgment with findings of fact (not just allegations or motions)
3. **Unlawful Deaths**: Court explicitly finds that unlawful killings or deaths occurred due to negligence/misconduct
4. **ICE Facilities**: Deaths occurred at ICE-operated or ICE-contracted detention facilities
5. **Timeline**: Deaths occurred between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2027
6. **Public Record**: Court documents available through PACER, court websites, or legal databases

**Qualifying Findings**:

- Medical negligence resulting in preventable deaths
- Use of excessive force leading to death
- Failure to provide adequate care, safety, or supervision
- Deliberate indifference to serious medical needs
- Unsafe conditions leading to fatalities

**Documentation Requirements**:

- Court must make factual findings, not just legal conclusions
- Specific facility and incident details in court record
- Clear causal connection between ICE custody and unlawful death

# Evidence and Reasoning

**Historical Pattern**:

- 40+ deaths in ICE custody reported between 2017-2020
- Previous court findings of inadequate medical care in ICE facilities
- Pattern of delayed or denied medical treatment documented by advocates
- Multiple ongoing lawsuits challenging ICE detention conditions

**Systemic Issues**:

- Private contractor facilities with profit incentives to minimize costs
- Inadequate medical staffing at many ICE facilities
- Limited oversight and transparency in detention operations
- Vulnerable population with existing health conditions
