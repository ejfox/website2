# Resolution Criteria

This prediction resolves **TRUE** if Donald Trump serves his complete second presidential term:

1. **Inauguration**: Trump is sworn in as President on January 20, 2025
2. **Continuous Service**: Holds the office of President from January 20, 2025 through January 20, 2029
3. **No Removal**: Not removed from office through any constitutional process (impeachment/conviction, 25th Amendment, resignation under pressure)
4. **End of Term**: Either leaves office voluntarily on January 20, 2029 or is succeeded by next president on that date

**Prediction Resolves TRUE Even If**:

- Trump is impeached by the House (but not removed by Senate)
- There are attempts to invoke 25th Amendment (but unsuccessful)
- Trump faces criminal charges or convictions while in office
- There are protests, political crises, or constitutional disputes
- Trump attempts to extend his term but ultimately leaves on January 20, 2029

**Prediction Resolves FALSE If**:

- Trump is removed via Senate conviction (67+ votes)
- Trump is removed via 25th Amendment (VP + Cabinet + Congress)
- Trump resigns from office
- Trump dies or becomes permanently incapacitated

**Edge Cases**:

- Brief temporary removal (surgical anesthesia, etc.) doesn't count if he resumes office

# Evidence and Reasoning

**Historical Precedent for Completion**:

- No US President has ever been removed from office via impeachment and Senate conviction
- Trump previously survived two impeachment attempts (Ukraine 2019, January 6th 2021)
- Even serious scandals (Watergate, Clinton impeachment) rarely result in removal
- Constitutional barriers to removal are intentionally high

**Senate Math for Removal**:

- Requires 67 Senate votes for conviction after House impeachment
- Current Senate composition makes 67 votes extremely unlikely
- Political polarization means few senators vote against party lines on impeachment
- Historical pattern shows senators rarely convict presidents of their own party

**25th Amendment Challenges**:

- Requires VP + majority of Cabinet to initiate, then 2/3 of both houses of Congress
- Trump likely to appoint loyal Cabinet members and VP
- Even higher bar than impeachment (2/3 vs simple majority in House + 2/3 in Senate)
- Designed for clear incapacitation, not political disagreements

**Supporting Factors**:

- Republican Party base remains loyal to Trump
- Legal challenges to presidency face high constitutional bars
- Presidential powers include significant self-protection mechanisms
- Four-year term is relatively short for sustained removal effort

**Risk Factors**:

- Age-related health issues (Trump will be 78-82 during term)
- Potential major scandal or crisis that shifts public/political opinion dramatically
- Criminal convictions potentially creating constitutional crisis
- Unprecedented situations that test constitutional removal mechanisms
