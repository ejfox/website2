# Evidence and Reasoning

Several factors support this prediction:

- Competition between major tech companies (Google, Meta, Anthropic, OpenAI) is intensifying
- Significant capital is being invested in AI research and infrastructure
- Recent papers show promising architectural improvements (MoE, improved attention mechanisms)
- Hardware capabilities continue to improve rapidly

The main uncertainty is whether the improvements will be incremental or represent a significant leap forward.
