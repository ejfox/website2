# Resolution Criteria

This prediction resolves **TRUE** if Zohran Mamdani wins the 2025 NYC mayoral election by >5% margin:

1. **Official Results**: NYC Board of Elections certified final results
2. **Election Type**: General election in November 2025 (not primary)
3. **Victory Required**: Mamdani must finish in 1st place (most votes)
4. **Margin Requirement**: Victory margin >5.0 percentage points over 2nd place candidate
5. **Candidate Verification**: Must be the Zohran Mamdani currently serving in NY State Assembly (District 36)

**Margin Calculation**:

- (Mamdani's percentage) - (2nd place candidate's percentage) > 5.0%
- Based on first-choice votes if ranked choice voting is used
- All ballot lines combined if candidates appear on multiple
- Includes all valid ballots (in-person, absentee, provisional)

**Edge Cases**:

- If Mamdani withdraws before general election, prediction resolves FALSE
- If election is postponed beyond 2025, prediction becomes void
- Recount results count if they change the certified outcome
- If he wins via ranked choice after redistribution, margin calculated on final round

# Evidence and Reasoning

**Mamdani's Political Position**:

- Progressive NY State Assembly member representing Queens District 36
- Member of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)
- Strong advocate for housing rights, worker protections, and social justice
- Vocal critic of moderate Democratic establishment
- Built name recognition through high-profile policy positions

**NYC Electoral Context**:

- Ranked choice voting may benefit progressive candidates
- Growing progressive movement in NYC (AOC, DSA successes)
- Historical NYC mayoral races often competitive with multiple viable candidates

**Progressive Electoral Performance**:

- DSA candidates have won multiple NYC races in recent cycles
- Progressive ballot initiatives often perform well in NYC
- Working Families Party has achieved >5% in previous mayoral races
- Left-wing candidates tend to outperform in high-turnout elections
