# Evidence and Reasoning

Remote work adoption has been steadily increasing since 2020:

- Many companies have made permanent remote work policies
- Real estate trends show office space reduction in major cities
- Technology infrastructure continues to improve for remote collaboration
- Employee preference surveys consistently show desire for remote options

However, there are counter-trends:
- Some major companies (Amazon, Apple) have return-to-office mandates
- Hybrid models seem to be more popular than fully remote
- Generational differences in remote work preference
