# Resolution Criteria

This prediction resolves **TRUE** if AI-generated code accounts for >30% of commits in the top 50 GitHub repositories:

1. **Repository Selection**: Top 50 repositories by star count on GitHub.com as of December 31, 2026
2. **AI-Generated Code Definition**: Code commits that can be reasonably attributed to AI assistance through:
   - Commit messages mentioning AI tools (Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
   - Automated detection of AI-generated patterns
   - Author self-identification of AI assistance
   - Analysis of code style/pattern consistency with known AI outputs

3. **Measurement Period**: All commits made between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2026
4. **Threshold**: Strictly greater than 30.0% of total commits
5. **Verification Method**: Combination of automated analysis tools and manual verification by independent researchers

**Calculation Method**:

- Count commits containing any AI-generated code (not lines of code)
- If commit contains both human and AI code, counts as AI-assisted
- Exclude purely administrative commits (version bumps, config changes, etc.)
- Include all branches that merged to main/master during the period

**Edge Cases**:

- If GitHub changes their starring system, use whatever equivalent "top repositories" metric exists
- Repositories that become private or are deleted are excluded from analysis
- Forks don't count separately - only original repositories

# Evidence and Reasoning

**Current AI Coding Adoption**:

- GitHub Copilot has millions of users and is integrated directly into development workflows
- AI coding assistants becoming standard in many companies and open source projects
- Observable increase in commit patterns consistent with AI assistance
- Growing acceptance of AI tools in professional development environments

**The "Junior Developer Plateau" Thesis**:

- AI excels at generating boilerplate code, simple functions, and tests
- Strong performance on well-defined coding tasks with clear patterns
- Current tools struggle with complex system architecture and design decisions
- Domain-specific knowledge and debugging complex legacy code remain challenging

**Supporting Factors for 30%+ Adoption**:

- Productivity gains from AI tools driving widespread adoption
- Cost savings for organizations using AI-assisted development
- Open source maintainers increasingly using AI to manage contribution volume
- Educational initiatives teaching AI-assisted coding becoming mainstream

**Limiting Factors (Plateau Concerns)**:

- Code commits may not properly credit AI assistance
- Complex architectural decisions still require human expertise
- Code review and quality control processes may limit AI code acceptance
- Performance optimization and debugging often require deep system understanding
- Security-sensitive projects may restrict AI tool usage

**Timeline Feasibility**:

- 2-year window allows for significant tool improvement and adoption
- Enough time for organizational policies and workflows to adapt
- Sufficient for next generation of AI coding tools to emerge and be adopted
