# Resolution Criteria

This prediction resolves **TRUE** if a criminal conviction occurs meeting ALL criteria:

1. **Criminal Conviction**: Defendant found guilty by court (plea deals count, but not just charges/indictments)
2. **Explicit Technology Citation**: Court documents explicitly mention "deepfake," "AI-generated media," "synthetic media," or equivalent technology terms
3. **Damage Amount**: Court determines damages of $10+ million USD (restitution orders, loss calculations, or damage assessments)
4. **Causal Connection**: Technology cited as direct cause or primary method of causing the damages
5. **Public Documentation**: Sentencing documents or court filings available in public records
6. **Timeline**: Conviction rendered by December 31, 2027

**Damage Calculation**:

- Direct financial losses to victims
- Restitution orders
- Market manipulation damages
- Corporate valuation impacts
- Multiple victim losses can be aggregated if part of single case/scheme

**Edge Cases**:

- Currency conversion to USD at time of conviction
- Federal and international courts count
- Civil settlements with criminal conviction count if damages specified
- Multiple defendants in same scheme count as single case

# Evidence and Reasoning

**Current Threat Landscape**:

- Voice cloning scams already causing millions in losses to individual companies
- CEO fraud via AI voice synthesis becoming increasingly common
- Financial sector particularly vulnerable to AI-enabled impersonation
- Cryptocurrency and wire fraud amplifying potential loss amounts

**Technology Accessibility**:

- Consumer-grade deepfake tools becoming increasingly sophisticated
- Real-time voice cloning achievable with minimal training data
- Video deepfakes approaching broadcast quality for short clips
- Costs decreasing rapidly (sub-$100 for convincing audio deepfakes)

**Legal System Catching Up**:

- First deepfake-related convictions already occurring in some jurisdictions
- Law enforcement developing AI crime investigation capabilities
- Courts beginning to understand and document AI technology in cases
- Federal agencies (FBI, FTC) prioritizing AI-enabled financial crimes

**High-Value Target Scenarios**:

- **Corporate Impersonation**: CEO voice cloning for wire transfer authorization
- **Market Manipulation**: Fake announcements using executive deepfakes
- **Investment Fraud**: Synthetic testimonials from fake executives/celebrities
- **Insurance Fraud**: Staged accidents or incidents using deepfake evidence
- **Cryptocurrency**: Fake endorsements leading to rug pulls or investment losses

**Recent Precedents**:

- Multiple cases of voice cloning causing $500K-$2M losses already documented
- Scaling to $10M+ likely as criminals target larger organizations
- Corporate victims more likely to pursue prosecution than individuals
- High-profile cases more likely to result in detailed court documentation

**Risk Factors**:

- Prosecution may focus on traditional fraud charges rather than deepfake technology
- Plea deals might not require detailed damage documentation
- International cases may be harder to verify
- Some victims may prefer private settlements to avoid publicity
