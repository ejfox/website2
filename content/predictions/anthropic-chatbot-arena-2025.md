# Resolution Criteria

This prediction resolves **TRUE** if an Anthropic model achieves and maintains the #1 position on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena leaderboard meeting ALL criteria:

1. **Platform**: LMSYS Chatbot Arena official overall leaderboard (chatbot.lmsys.org)
2. **Position**: #1 ranking (not tied for first)
3. **Model**: Any Anthropic model (Claude series)
4. **Duration**: Must hold #1 position for 60 consecutive days minimum
5. **Verification**: Position confirmed through archived leaderboard data (Wayback Machine, screenshots, etc.)

**Edge Cases**:

- If leaderboard methodology changes significantly, prediction becomes void
- Temporary outages/maintenance don't reset the counter if position is maintained
- Multiple Anthropic models can't combine - must be single model holding position
- ELO score ties count as shared #1, which doesn't satisfy this prediction
