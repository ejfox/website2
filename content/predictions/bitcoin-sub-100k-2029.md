# Resolution Criteria

This prediction resolves **TRUE** if Bitcoin trades below $100,000 USD meeting ALL criteria:

1. **Price Source**: CoinGecko daily closing price for Bitcoin (BTC/USD)
2. **Threshold**: Daily closing price below $100,000.00 USD
3. **Duration**: 7 consecutive calendar days (168 hours minimum)
4. **Timeline**: Any 7-day period between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2029
5. **Verification**: Archived CoinGecko data or equivalent major price aggregator

**Price Calculation**:

- Daily closing price in USD (typically 00:00 UTC)
- If CoinGecko unavailable, fallback to CoinMarketCap or major exchange consensus
- Brief intraday wicks below $100k don't count - must be sustained closing prices
- All 7 days must have closes <$100,000 (not just low touches)

**Edge Cases**:

- Market halts or exchange outages don't reset the counter if price remains below
- Fork events: follows the "Bitcoin" ticker that maintains majority hash rate
- If multiple "Bitcoin" chains exist, follows the one trading as BTC on major exchanges

# Evidence and Reasoning

**Historical Volatility Patterns**:

- Bitcoin has experienced 80%+ drawdowns multiple times (2018: $20k→$3k, 2022: $69k→$15k)
- Cyclical boom-bust pattern roughly aligned with halving cycles
- Previous bull markets followed by extended bear markets lasting 1-2 years
- Current price levels ($100k+) represent 300%+ gains from 2023 lows

**Contrarian Factors**:

- Growing institutional adoption (ETFs, corporate treasuries)
- Increasing regulatory clarity in some jurisdictions
- Network effects and first-mover advantages
- Fixed supply cap becoming more relevant as adoption grows
- Potential for major geopolitical events driving safe-haven demand
