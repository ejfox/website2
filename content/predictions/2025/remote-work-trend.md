## Evidence and Reasoning

This is a contrarian prediction based on several emerging trends:

### Factors Supporting a Return to Office

1. **Management Pressure**: Many executives prefer in-person collaboration
2. **Real Estate Investments**: Companies have significant sunk costs in office space
3. **Cultural Shift**: Younger workers seeking mentorship and social connections
4. **Productivity Concerns**: Some studies show decreased productivity for certain roles

### Counter-Evidence

1. **Employee Preferences**: Surveys show strong preference for flexibility
2. **Cost Savings**: Companies save on real estate and utilities
3. **Talent Access**: Remote work enables global talent acquisition
4. **Technology Improvements**: Better tools for remote collaboration

## Key Metrics to Track

- Bureau of Labor Statistics remote work data
- Major tech company policy announcements
- Commercial real estate occupancy rates
- Employee satisfaction surveys

I assign low confidence (30%) because employee preferences strongly favor flexibility, and companies that force return-to-office may face talent retention issues.
