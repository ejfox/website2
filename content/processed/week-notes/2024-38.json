Went with this vision prompt:\n\n>Describe this image in detail, breaking it down into the following aspects: 1) Main subject matter, 2) Visual elements like composition and setting, 3) Any visible technical content (such as code or devices) with a focus on the general purpose or functionality rather than specifics, and 4) Inferred context, such as time of day, season, or mood. Finally, generate 5-20 relevant tags based on the description, aiming to include tags like 'code,' 'photography,' 'art,' 'nature,' '3d,' or other relevant terms from a wide range of topics. Try to keep your description under 400 words. Avoid lists. At the end, make some inferences/guesses as to what the user is doing, if applicable. Keep your answer as information-dense and succinct as possible. Try to capture the overall gist of the image as well as the specifics. Never respond in the negative.\n\n### Scrapbook-core\n\nWorking on getting this deployed to fly.io on a cronjob so I don't have to run it by hand, which means my bookmarks are almost always out of sync lately.\n\n### Updated blog\n\nI worked on creating [a custom markdown->json parser](https://gist.github.com/ejfox/333fa5fa676160b2e5757160a62f555c) I could use to power my blog, since the bug that's preventing me from running my blog with `@nuxt/content` hasn't been fixed yet and I am extremely impatient.\n\n<!-- Log coding progress, creative work, or interesting discoveries -->\n\n## üìö Learning & Media\n<!-- Books, articles, movies, TV shows, podcasts consumed -->\n\n## üîó Connections & Insights\n<!-- Note any interesting connections between ideas or new realizations -->\n\n## üéØ Next Week's Intentions\n<!-- What do you want to focus on or accomplish next week? -->\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726593376/Screenshot_2024-09-17_at_1.16.03_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726775810/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_3.56.36_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726776670/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_4.10.58_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726776719/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_4.11.45_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726776739/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_4.12.07_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726777439/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_4.23.47_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726778607/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_4.43.15_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726778982/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_4.49.30_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726779434/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_4.57.01_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726779439/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_4.57.07_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726780671/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_5.17.38_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/v1726781012/Screen_Recording_2024-09-19_at_5.22.05_PM.mov)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726785675/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_6.41.01_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726791978/Screenshot_2024-09-19_at_8.26.03_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/v1726857323/Screen_Recording_2024-09-20_at_2.35.06_PM.mov)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/v1726925203/Screen_Recording_2024-09-21_at_9.25.45_AM.mov)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/v1726926152/Screen_Recording_2024-09-21_at_9.42.09_AM.mov)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726926857/Screenshot_2024-09-21_at_9.54.06_AM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726926871/Screenshot_2024-09-21_at_9.54.19_AM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726926877/Screenshot_2024-09-21_at_9.54.26_AM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726926883/Screenshot_2024-09-21_at_9.54.32_AM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/v1726927925/Screen_Recording_2024-09-21_at_10.10.50_AM.mov)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/v1726928052/Screen_Recording_2024-09-21_at_10.13.07_AM.mov)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/v1726929283/Screen_Recording_2024-09-21_at_10.34.19_AM.mov)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726930224/Screenshot_2024-09-21_at_10.50.01_AM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1726930804/Screenshot_2024-09-21_at_10.59.52_AM.png)\n"
