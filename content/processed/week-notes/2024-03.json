  "content": "## 🌟 Overview of the Week\n- Summarize the general mood and key themes of the week here.\n\n## 💻 Projects Worked On\n\n### Remaking the Room302.studio Website\n\n### <https://knowhv.com/>\n\n## 📘 Learning & Development\n- Watched this [video from reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/1957ngc/rare_tank_battle_between_ukrainian_bradley_and/) of a tank battle between a Ukrainian Bradley, which sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole. [This is the same video, but narrated and annotated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKvmpcLbZFA) which makes it a little bit easier to understand. I then ended up on this incredible [30 minutes of go-pro footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYvMc-tQvkM) from an American fighting on the front lines. This era of high-definition imagery in near-realtime from battlefields across the world is very strange.\n\n- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHfZ2972mr0>\n- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFj_ULMjcNQ>\n- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IQdAQ-7hxM>\n- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooCoej-31uk>\n- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wCLbiHvsMg>\n\nI've been watching a lot of YouTube videos from survival/prepper/outdoors folks and one thing I keep noticing is that people will do a whole 10 minute video on some sort of preparation, but never actually talk about the situation they are preparing for. This is especially noticeable in YouTube videos about radios or military equipment.\n\nThese guys keep talking about having equipment to navigate and survive in \"non-permissive environments\" with their Every Day Carry or Bug Out Bags. In Cybersecurity, the first step towards building a defense is to create a [Threat Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model) that describes the likely motives and tactics of potential attackers.\n\n### Experimenting with Tres js\n\nTres JS <https://tresjs.org> is a Vue wrapper around the 3D web graphics library Three.js- and it makes it very easy to integrate 3D scenes into Vue components using Vue's reactivity system, and making it easy to pull in other helpers like VueUse. So far, I am enjoying the technology, but finding the documentation and examples a bit lacking, so I am finding myself stumbling around aimlessly sometimes.\n\n![https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1705897187/Screenshot_2024-01-21_at_11.19.35_PM.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1705897187/Screenshot_2024-01-21_at_11.19.35_PM.png)\n\n### Experimenting with Anime JS 4.0\n\n## 🌱 Personal Growth & Health\n- Reading NOLS Wilderness Medicine to be better prepared to use my first aid kit if necessary while motorcycle camping next summer\n\n### Building A First Aid Kit For Motorcycle Travel\n- Emergency Blanket\n- Rolled aluminum splint\n- Neosporin\n- Athletic Tape\n- Medical Shears\n- QuickClot Gauze\n- Gauze (rolls + dressings)\n- Rubber Gloves\n"
