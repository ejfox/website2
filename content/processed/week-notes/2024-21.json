  "content": "## ðŸŒŸ Overview of the Week\n\nTrying to decide whether I want to move when my lease is up in August. I hate moving. I want to get closer to the city, but even going back to beacon looks like an extra $1000 a month.\n\nI forgot that Coach Artie was in my friend's Discord server and he ended up\n\n![](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1716768321/Screenshot_2024-05-26_at_8.05.09_PM.png)\n\n## Projects Worked On\n\n### Room 302 Studio Mission Control\n\n\n## Creative Endeavors\n\n### Scheduling kiln rental to get ceramics bisque fired\n\n![My collection of greenware bowls, cups, and plates ready to be fired](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1716386448/Screenshot_2024-05-22_at_10.00.32_AM.png)\n\n## Technical Accomplishments\n\n### Released v2.0.0 of gpt-browser package\n```shell\nnpx @ejfox/gpt-browser --url https://example.com\n```\n\n![Video of gpt-browser in action](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/v1716307964/Screen_Recording_2024-05-21_at_12.11.38_PM.jpg)\n\n### Amigo Sampler\n\nPlayed around a bit with the [Amigo Sampler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB6mkL6x1DE) in Logic along with the [Push 64](https://www.ableton.com/en/push/) - definitely a lot of fun to play around with.\n\n## Transcribing Videos with FFMPEG and Whisper.cpp\n\nThis week, I discovered a quick and efficient way to transcribe video files using FFMPEG and Whisper.cpp.\n\n1. Convert the video files to 16-bit WAV audio format using FFMPEG:\n```shell\nfor file in *.m4v; do ffmpeg -i \"$file\" -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le \"${file%.m4v}.wav\"; done\n```\n\n2. Transcribe the resulting WAV files using Whisper.cpp:\n```shell\ncd /Users/ejfox/whisper.cpp\nfor file in /Users/ejfox/Downloads/FieldTalk/*.wav; do ./main -f \"$file\" -l en --output-vtt; done\n```\n\n3. Convert .vtt to plaintext\n```shell\nawk '!/-->/' CodeAndNature.wav.vtt >> CodeAndNature.wav.txt\n```\n\n## Books, Movies, TV\n- Been watching the new season of The Jinx\n- Also watching the new season of Hacks\n- Reading NOLS Wilderness First Aid\n\n## Personal Growth & Health\n\nBeen trying to put more conscious effort into eating more fruit, especially when I am craving sweet things, itâ€™s going pretty good so far\n\n## Social & Community Engagement\n\n\n## Goals for the Future\n<!-- Set Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals or intentions for the upcoming week. -->\n"
