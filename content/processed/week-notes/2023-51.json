The fun-to-effort ratio is out of this world, and I mostly worked as an editor and choose-your-own-adventure player. It's cheesy and dumb, but it made me laugh a few times, and it's as entertaining as any other poorly-written TV show I could be watching.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Every time we hit a decision point, I would ask for 5-10 approaches of how to continue. Sometimes I would choose one, or combinations. I probably only wrote 2 or 3 lines of dialogue myself in the entire thing. I also ended up discarding 2-3 times the content that I ended up using. I also struggled a lot to get ChatGPT to be creative enough for me; most of the best content came from dialing the temperature up to 2, turning half-p down to 0.5 or so, and pasting the entire contents of the story until then (with no chat/assistant dialogue to confuse it).</p>\n<h2 class=\"\" id=\"technical-accomplishments\">Technical Accomplishments</h2>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"youtube-watch-later-scraping\">YouTube 'Watch Later' Scraping</h3>\n<p class=\"\">It is annoyingly difficult to pull down your entire Watch Later playlist, which for me, is over 300 videos that are extremely specific to my interests. Unfortunately for me, they are all mashed together in increasingly-inaccessible parts of the YouTube UI, and I want to be able to use them to create my own tools for watching things I have decided are worth watching, rather than doomscrolling.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc\">\n<li class=\"\">Step 1: Go to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=WL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Watch Later</a> page on YouTube</li>\n<li class=\"\">Step 2: Scroll to the very bottom of the page</li>\n<li class=\"\">Step 3: <code class=\"md-inline-code\">Inspect Element</code> on one of the Watch Later videos, and find the parent DOM element that holds all of them</li>\n<li class=\"\">Step 4: <code class=\"md-inline-code\">Copy as HTML</code> and paste into a new file</li>\n<li class=\"\">Step 5: Add some styles and javascript to hide parts of the page we don't want</li>\n<li class=\"\">Step 6: <code class=\"md-inline-code\">Select All</code> on our newly-trimmed page, and copy into <code class=\"md-inline-code\">watchlater.txt</code></li>\n<li class=\"\">Step 7: Run the text file through <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/ejfox/643e4f5339ae54da1722ad8d5c79e4ab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">text-to-csv.js</a> to create a .csv of links</li>\n<li class=\"\">Step 8: Finally, at long last, have my Watch Later playlist as data I can use elsewhere</li>\n</ul>",
