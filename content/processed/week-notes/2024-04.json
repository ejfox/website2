I edited our initial 3 hour interview down about 50%, but that's still 90 minutes, and I haven't even gotten to our most recent interview which recaps his research over the year since our last interview.\n\n## ðŸŽ¨ Creative Endeavors\n- List art created, mediums used, and significant writings or quotes.\n\n### Livestream on Coach Artie\n\nDid a [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od5aqBwYU-I) with room302.studio going over the latest updates to Coach Artie\n"
