I‚Äôve been listening to Sherlock Holmes read by Stephen Fry, and in some of the stories Holmes will consult his own notebooks with interesting newspaper clippings and biographies of various figures, from which he can produce unique insights and connections to solve his mysteries. I am inspired by this system.\n\nI have over 8,000 bookmarks in Pinboard, from the past decade of being a person on the internet, and I am really excited at the idea of making them easier to flip through, analyze, rediscover, assemble and thread together, and show to other people.\n\n<https://github.com/ejfox/scrapbook-core>\n\n### Scrapscroller\n\n<https://ejfoxscrapsroller.netlify.app>\n\nCreated an initial ‚Äúhello world‚Äù repo / app for my infinite scrolling interface into my scrapbook- it turned out pretty cool! I want to spend some time refining the actual swipe animations to make it smoother, but I am really proud of how quickly it came together with the help of Claude.\n\n### Scrapbook-cli\n\n![Scrapbook CLI - a command line interface to search and see a list of scraps - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/v1717273831/Screen_Recording_2024-06-01_at_4.29.44_PM.mov)\n\n<https://github.com/ejfox/scrapbook-cli>\n\n### Added Pottery Section to Website\n\nI checked on my pottery at the studio over the weekend, cooling in the kiln, and I am beginning to allow myself to feel excited about glazing and finishing this collection.\n\n<https://ejfox.com/pottery>\n\nSo I celebrated by making a new pottery section on my website, powered by Stripe, so that I can sell some pieces. I have made way too much to keep or give away, and this is an expensive hobby.\n\n### Added RSS feeds to ejfox.com and ejfox.photos\n\nRSS feeds are a crucial part of breaking away from the shackles of mainstream social media for distributing my work, but its been a pain to get it working in Nuxt. I finally got it done, making RSS feeds both from my website‚Äôs Markdown content with Nuxt Content, and also converting a Cloudinary API result into a properly formatted feed. But they both exist now!\n\n## Books, Movies, TV\n- <https://youtu.be/JheGL6uSF-4?si=4h4XrM8SzBKy2UtT>\n\n---\n\n### LLM Pricing: May 2024\n\n| Model                | Input Price (per million tokens) | Output Price (per million tokens) | Notes                                                |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| GPT-4o               | $5.00                            | $15.00                            |                                                      |\n| GPT-4o-2024-05-13    | $5.00                            | $15.00                            |                                                      |\n| Haiku                | $0.25                            | $1.25                             |        |\n| Sonnet               | $3.00                            | $15.00                            |         |\n| Opus                 | $15.00                           | $75.00                            |         |\n| Google AI (prompts < 128K tokens)   | $3.50                            | $10.50                            |                                         |\n| Google AI (prompts > 128K tokens)   | $7.00                            | $21.00                            |                                         |\n\n![Screenshot](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1717229300/Screenshot_2024-06-01_at_4.08.07_AM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1717272100/Screenshot_2024-06-01_at_4.01.28_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1717357922/Screenshot_2024-06-02_at_3.51.48_PM.png)\n"
