I also added some basic controls for size, so you can arrange all of the blocks in a channel spatially in any way that makes sense to your brain\n\n## Creative Endeavors\n\n\n## Books, Movies, TV\n\n\n## Personal Growth & Health\n\n\n## Social & Community Engagement\n\n\n## Goals for the Future\n\n- Story idea: where do motorcycle crashes happen in the Hudson Valley\n<!-- Set Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals or intentions for the upcoming week. -->\n\n---\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1718126253/Screenshot_2024-06-11_at_1.17.22_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1718209833/Screenshot_2024-06-12_at_12.30.21_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1718210031/Screenshot_2024-06-12_at_12.33.37_PM.png)\n\n![Screenshot - - ](http://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1718226055/Screenshot_2024-06-12_at_5.00.41_PM.png)\n"
