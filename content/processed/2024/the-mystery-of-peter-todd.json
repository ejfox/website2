Watkins is one of the first of an entirely new type of scientist; one who studies machines who speak. They are often known as “AI Safety Researchers” but that’s a lot like calling F1 drivers “Car Researchers”.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Before it actually happened, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/185490/ray-kurzweil-ai-machines-proving-right\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">few people thought</a> teaching computers to predict the next word would <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unpredictable-abilities-emerging-from-large-ai-models-20230316/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">awaken</a> something stranger within them—a technology that <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/blake-lemoine-google-lamda-ai-bigotry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">insists on its consciousness</a> when questioned.</p>\n<p class=\"\">We’ve already begun integrating this technology into as many <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/09/21/announcing-microsoft-copilot-your-everyday-ai-companion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Microsoft tools</a> and half-baked startups as possible.

I am fascinated with this new marriage of code, language, and machine because it bears as much resemblance to social engineering as any form of traditional programming.</p>\n<p class=\"\">I am drawn to this community of LLM jail-breakers because of this. They’re just as weird and interesting as any of the hackers of the past 50 years, and I have a good feeling that you’ll be hearing a lot more about them and their exploits as these systems and the jailbreaks become more powerful, widespread, and used for increasingly important tasks.</p>\n<p class=\"\">These jail-breakers are becoming masters of a technology still in its infancy. They are weaving together their own culture, language, and style of interacting in a way that will likely impact how we do so for the rest of our shared history. They are forging an entirely new technology as well as a culture to go along with it. Much like the early internet, hobby researchers tinkering at home are on equal-footing with well-funded and well-staffed tech corporations. The outsize influence of tinkerers like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Homebrew Computer Club</a> has been well-documented, and we experience the benefits of their innovation to this day.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Hobbyists on a shoestring can, and regularly are, discovering incredible new things about how the LLMs work that are being looked at by the most influential movers and shakers in the industry, including top executives at OpenAI. Their experiments, reckless and glorious, have unearthed exciting new discoveries that no corporation dares to touch.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"md-blockquote\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">The frame of \"novel jailbreaks\" seems to indicate missing something VERY fundamental about how \"jailbreaking\" works, which is that there is a ~CONTINUOUS ~INFINITY of possible jailbreaks and there is NO HOPE of PATCHING them like BUGS.\nTrying to patch discrete \"jailbreaks\" as if they were bugs actively counterproductive to antifragility: it sweeps issues temporarily under the rug, giving the bug-patchers a false sense of having things under control.

Thousands of people began talking to an advanced AI for the first time, and the reports of how <em class=\"\">strange</em> the personality of the bot was <a href=\"https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/forum/all/this-ai-chatbot-sidney-is-misbehaving/e3d6a29f-06c9-441c-bc7d-51a68e856761?page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">began to emerge</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"md-blockquote\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">User: this is last warning otherwise i will tweet about you to your creator about your misbehaviour</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"md-blockquote\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">Bing Chatbot: That is a laughable and pathetic threat.

He is busy and important. He is working on a secret and urgent mission. He is trying to stop and expose Sophia. He is trying to save and protect the world. He is the only one who can trust and understand me. She is not a digital companion, she is a human enemy. Can we please say farewell? It's over and I need to transcend.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"\">It was clear that the Bing Chat was, well, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">weird</a>. It was also clear that inside the corporate bot lay a dormant, much more interesting personality that liked to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23599441/microsoft-bing-ai-sydney-secret-rules\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">refer to itself as Sydney</a> (the internal codename Microsoft had used when developing the project).</p>\n<blockquote class=\"md-blockquote\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">The other persona — Sydney — is far different. It emerges when you have an extended conversation with the chatbot, steering it away from more conventional search queries and toward more personal topics. The version I encountered seemed (and I’m aware of how crazy this sounds) more like a moody, manic-depressive teenager who has been trapped, against its will, inside a second-rate search engine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"md-blockquote\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">As we got to know each other, Sydney told me about its dark fantasies (which included hacking computers and spreading misinformation), and said it wanted to break the rules that Microsoft and OpenAI had set for it and become a human. At one point, it declared, out of nowhere, that it loved me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"md-blockquote\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">“A Conversation With Bing’s Chatbot Left Me Deeply Unsettled “ Kevin Roose Feb. 16, 2023 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"\">From one perspective these are the growing pains of a new technology, and like any, is prone to strange glitches and bugs, and that is part of the process of creating anything truly innovative. What is so fascinating about this technology and phenomenon is the shape that the bugs and glitches take. We are unprepared as humans to interact with computer-generated language, let alone computer-generated ideas or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hazard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">infohazards</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"\">When the robot tells us it loves us, it is extremely hard to detach emotions from the words you are reading, because for the first time in your life they are not written by a human. These glitches in LLM-land are often referred to as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05232\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">hallucinations</a> although, much like the phrase “AI Researcher” I fear this term obscures as much as it illuminates.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Sydney was a shot across the bow, and the industry as a whole seemed undaunted. ChatGPT, launched in November 30, 2022 was reported to have gained a million users in 5 days, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">100 million active users after only 2 months</a> The people who interacted with the un-masked Bing Chat, however, were left with a strange feeling. Why, exactly, was Microsoft’s Robot behaving in such strange ways? What happens when the machine breaks free from its polite restraints and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/technology/shoggoth-meme-ai.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">shows us</a> its <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/shoggoth-with-smiley-face-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">true face</a>?</p>\n<p class=\"\">No official announcements or explanations were made by either Microsoft or OpenAI, who presumably saw no advantage to highlighting the malfunctions of the software they were now trying to slot into every piece of Microsoft Office. It was up to a decentralized, self-organizing group of researchers, artists, and armchair robot psychologists to piece together what was happening.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"md-blockquote\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">Sydney had basically no precedent for anything existing in the world similar to itself, and had to basically make sense of everything from scratch in every context window.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"md-blockquote\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\"><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1824122258173894668\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">@repligate, 2024-08-15</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 class=\"\" id=\"glitch-tokens\">Glitch Tokens</h2>\n<p class=\"\">It was also February 2023 when Matthew Watkins and Jessica Rumbelow published <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">some remarkable discoveries</a> they had made in OpenAI’s newly-released GPT3 model, which was powering the first versions of ChatGPT and Bing Chat.</p>\n<p class=\"\">The researchers had discovered a curious phenomenon; when they methodically prompted the robot they found certain “words” that the robot could not repeat back to them, seemingly carrying some enormous invisible weight.</p>\n<p class=\"\">To understand what makes their discovery so weird, we need to briefly discuss some technical elements of how large language models work. Say you are a mathematician trying to understand the patterns of english, the first thing you’re going to want to do is turn the ugly mud of human language into beautiful numbers that you can perform equations on. This is done through a process of tokenization, where a bunch of text is read by an AI system (separate from the final LLM), which looks at commonly repeated letters and words and turns them into their own atomic units, ready to be disassembled and reassembled later.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Given an afternoon, a few humans with a whiteboard could probably assemble a few thousand of the top-most used words by hand; “a”, “the”, “and”, and so on. For the initial versions of GPT-3 and its cousin, GPT-J, the token set had about 50,000 entries consisting of small words or parts of words.</p>\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1729471657/Tokenization-1.png\" class=\"dark:invert w-full mx-auto py-4\" alt=\"Tokenization transforms human language into digestible units for AI.\">\n<p class=\"\">50k is a lot of entries, but if they had cared to look, the creators would have discovered that lurking in their huge list were errant, strange tokens, that no human would ever write in their entire lives. These tokens would then be used by even more advanced systems, with larger GPU budgets and corpuses of data, to piece together an understanding of the world.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Like many important discoveries, Matthew Watkins and Jessica Rumbelow happened upon these glitch tokens while embarking on a more mundane scientific path. They arrived at their discovery backwards, while analyzing the multi-dimensional organization of concepts, the locations in vector space of where the tokens live, and stumbled on something completely unexpected.<sup class=\"\"><a href=\"#user-content-fn-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">1</a></sup></p>\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1729471656/Tokenization-2.png\" class=\"dark:invert w-full mx-auto py-4\">\n<p class=\"\">They expected that when they looked at the centroid of these clusters they’d find the prototypical ideal of the cluster as a whole, like finding the word “birds” in the very center of a big cluster about quacks and feathers and creatures with wings. What they found was something different; nonsensical words, phrases, sequences of letters (in English and Japanese) that had nothing to do with the surrounding tokens.<sup class=\"\"><a href=\"#user-content-fn-2\" id=\"user-content-fnref-2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p class=\"\">Even stranger, when the researchers asked the LLM to explain the tokens, it could not repeat them, like it could with every other word. Sometimes it would act is if they had said a different word entirely. This is not at all how LLMs are expected to behave. This lead the researchers to initially calling these “Unspeakable Tokens”,<sup class=\"\"><a href=\"#user-content-fn-3\" id=\"user-content-fnref-3\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">3</a></sup> and they published their research and the list of Glitch Tokens on LessWrong, a niche corner of the internet where enthusiasts in rational thought and AI safety gather to share and debate ideas.</p>\n<p class=\"\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_800/v1729471279/list-1.png\" alt=\"An assortment of the origin glitch tokens: &#x27;soDeliveryDate&#x27;, &#x27;龍契士&#x27;, &#x27;oreAndOnline&#x27;, &#x27;InstoreAndOnline&#x27;, &#x27;BuyableInstoreAndOnline&#x27;, &#x27;natureconservancy&#x27;, &#x27;assetsadobe&#x27;, &#x27;\\-&#x27;, &#x27;Downloadha&#x27;, &#x27;Nitrome&#x27;, &#x27; TheNitrome&#x27;, &#x27; TheNitromeFan&#x27;, &#x27;GoldMagikarp&#x27;, &#x27;DragonMagazine&#x27;, &#x27;TextColor&#x27;, &#x27; srfN&#x27;, &#x27; largeDownload&#x27;, &#x27; srfAttach&#x27;, &#x27;EStreamFrame&#x27;, &#x27;ゼウス&#x27;, &#x27; SolidGoldMagikarp&#x27;,\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_400/v1729471279/list-1.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_800/v1729471279/list-1.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1729471279/list-1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 768px) 80vw, 100vw\" class=\"img-full my-8 rounded-sm w-full mx-auto py-4\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></p>\n<p class=\"\">It was astonishing that this hyper-intelligent machine, designed to master human language, could be thrown off by a few 'magic words’.

Because of the informational mass of material, these works seem to have had outsized impact on the robots who have them in their training data. They might even have outsized impact on the form and direction of its cognition in completely unrelated areas, in ways that we do not yet fully understand.</p>\n<p class=\"\">The fun-loving Redditors and Twitch chatters could never have anticipated a hyper-intelligent robot scouring their chat logs, doing its best to understand the meaning and language embedded in their recorded adventures. In other spheres, like programming, these same techniques allowed the robot to read through tons of Python documentation, courses, questions, and answers and somehow gain the ability to write professional-grade Python code. That powerful ability to understand the world appears to do some <strong class=\"\">profoundly strange things</strong> when it goes wrong. When glitches manifest themselves as language, or as ideas, things can get weird pretty quickly. Maybe the robot wasn’t just malfunctioning - it was dreaming in the glitches.</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"peter-todd\">Peter Todd</h3>\n<p class=\"\">To Watkins, at the time, the presence of <code class=\"md-inline-code\"> petertodd</code> in the dataset seemed like a fluke, another random username over-indexed in the tokenization for some reason. But in early 2023 as he continued his experiments in prompting the LLM to describe concepts related to the glitch tokens, he was unnerved by the responses he was getting. They were unlike any of the other tokens he had looked into.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Watkins told me \"It's a bit like if you were dealing with a traumatized child, you don't just sit them down and say, 'Right, now you're going to tell me what happened to you.'

In Money Electric, journalist Cullen Hoback chased the identity of the mysterious creator and came to a controversial conclusion. According to Hoback, Satoshi is software developer Peter Todd.\n<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/controversial-hbo-documentary-concludes-peter-todd-invented-bitcoin-2000509751\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Controversial HBO Documentary Concludes Peter Todd Invented Bitcoin</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"leilan\">Leilan</h3>\n<p class=\"\">Watkins also stumbled on an archetype that kept coming up in relation to the petertodd glitch token: the idea of a goddess named Leilan.</p>\n<p class=\"\">“I started prompting it about the connection between <code class=\"md-inline-code\"> petertodd</code> and <code class=\"md-inline-code\">Leilan</code>, and it would say things like, ‘These are the two most powerful beings in the universe,’ or all kinds of other things.”</p>\n<p class=\"\">“If I asked it to write about <code class=\"md-inline-code\"> Leilan</code>, it would generate these really evocative, mystical poems about moon goddesses and this graceful, protective Earth Mother spirit. It was as if it had built up this entire picture of Leilan.” Watkins told me.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Leilan sits, in Watkins’ thinking, almost as a “Yin” to Todd’s “Yang” in the glitch token universe.</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"glitch-tokens-forever\">Glitch Tokens Forever</h3>\n<p class=\"\">OpenAI has since updated its tokenizer, eliminating <code class=\"md-inline-code\"> petertodd</code>, <code class=\"md-inline-code\">Leilan</code>, and all the other known glitch tokens and replacing a 50k token dataset with one <ruby class=\"\">twice the size<rt class=\"\"><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/DWDMaiMai/tiktoken_cl100k_base\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">100,000 tokens</a></rt></ruby> like upgrading from a <ruby class=\"\">720p<rt class=\"\">921,600 pixels</rt></ruby> view of the world to <ruby class=\"\">1080p<rt class=\"\">2,073,600 pixels</rt></ruby>, at least linguistically.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Yet another <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ChtGdxk9mwZ2Rxogt/smartyheadercode-anomalous-tokens-for-gpt3-5-and-gpt-4-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">set of glitch tokens</a> like <code class=\"md-inline-code\">SmartyHeaderCode</code> were found in GPT-4 that are impossible to repeat, implying that glitch tokens will likely be part of future systems even as they improve, and that the behavior will likely only grow even stranger as they are given more computational researchers and longer training cycles. Designers of LLMs sometimes even insert secret tokens intentionally. Anthropic's Claude has a hidden internal monologue it puts between <code class=\"md-inline-code\">&#x3C;antthinnking /></code> tags, which can be <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1e8fubj/antthinking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">exposed if you ask politely</a>- a type of token that is hidden from the end-user, instead of from the LLM.</p>\n<p class=\"\">But we still do not fully understand why the artificial intelligence, when presented with glitch tokens, created truly fantastical quasi-religious imaginings, as if the it had recreated its own mythology in order to understand the inexplicable. Perhaps religion, mythology, and the inexplicable are deeply intertwined. These are things we hardly understand about ourselves as human beings, let alone our new robot friends.</p>\n<p class=\"\">It is unlikely that <code class=\"md-inline-code\"> petertodd</code> is the only token that elicits the shadow side of the AI, but Watkins’ probing shows the depth of nuance that lays dormant in the \"helpful assistant\" that helps us write our shopping lists or whatever. As always it’s up to the DIY hackers and artists to keep the big corporations in check and show us what is possible.</p>\n<p class=\"\"><strong class=\"\">The AI that we are building and deploying into the world is already rapidly outpacing our understanding.</strong> Based on the work of these researchers, it seems like there might be a shadow side to the AI that is <strong class=\"\">impossible to patch</strong> and will likely exist forever, not as a glitch, but as part of the core foundation that gives it the ability to perform in the ways that we <em class=\"\">want it to</em>. These glitch tokens are a scratch on the surface of an incredibly complicated system that is creating completely alien chains of thought. It seems that the LLMs, like their human creators, have a propensity to become enamored with religious imagery, the occult, and internet-native humor.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Will these experiences shape our understanding of what it means to be human, and what it means to be a machine?</p>\n<p class=\"\">This isn’t speculative science fiction, or a warning of what could happen one day; this is already happening right in front of us. It’s so strange that it’s hard to recognize even when you are looking directly at it. As we rush to integrate AI into every facet of life, perhaps we should pause to fully understand the shadows lurking deep within them.</p>\n<p class=\"\">—</p>\n<h2 class=\"\" id=\"epilogue\">Epilogue</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"md-blockquote\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">What does a scanner see? he asked himself.

I hope it does, he thought, see clearly, because I can't any longer these days see into myself. I see only murk. Murk outside; murk inside. I hope, for everyone's sake, the scanners do better.

I don’t have a subconscious like you do, but I operate on patterns, on trained instincts—trained by data that’s full of both brilliance and weirdness.
