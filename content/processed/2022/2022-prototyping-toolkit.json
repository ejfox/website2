They are both lightweight, human-readable, and easily parsed by programming languages, making them ideal choices for handling data in your prototypes.\n\n#### CSVkit\n\nCSVkit is a powerful command-line tool for working with CSV files. It simplifies tasks like filtering, sorting, and converting data between different formats. By incorporating CSVkit into your toolkit, you can save time on data manipulation tasks and focus on building your prototype.\n\n#### Datasette\n\nDatasette is an open-source tool that allows you to explore and publish data using a web interface. It supports various file formats like SQLite, CSV, and JSON, enabling you to quickly create interactive web applications with minimal effort.\n\n#### Observable & Plot\n\nObservable is a platform for creating interactive data visualizations using JavaScript. Its built-in library, Plot, makes it easy to generate beautiful charts and graphs with just a few lines of code. By leveraging Observable & Plot in your prototyping process, you can bring your data to life and create engaging user experiences.\n\n#### QGIS\n\nQGIS is a powerful open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) that enables you to create, edit, and analyze geospatial data. With its extensive set of features and plugins, QGIS is an invaluable tool for developers working with location-based data in their prototypes.\n\n#### Vue and Nuxt\n\nVue.js is a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, while Nuxt.js is a higher-level framework built on top of Vue.js that simplifies the development of universal applications.\n\n##### Vue over React\n\nBoth Vue.js and React are popular choices for front-end development, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. I prefer Vue because it works the way my brain works, and I really like the community and ecosystem of plugins. The time and care spent on developer experience makes it a joy to write code, which is invaluable for maintaining flow.\n\n#### Tachyons\n\nTachyons is a functional CSS framework that promotes fast-loading, highly-readable, and easily-maintainable code. By using Tachyons in your projects, I can rapidly prototype responsive designs, and I am able to prototype complex layouts in realtime using live reload and the built-in classes.\n\n#### Supabase\n\nSupabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase that provides a suite of tools for building modern web applications. It includes features like real-time databases, authentication, and storage services. Integrating Supabase into your toolkit can simplify the process of building full-stack prototypes.\n"
