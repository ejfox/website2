As a DJ you get used to changing tunes to match the vibe of the audience, and I tried to capture the growing energy that happens.\n\nThe first playlist begins at 7PM, but I've been known to put it on first thing in the morning. It is calm background music as people gather and talk and hang out.\n\nWe build and increase the BPM over the course of the night, culminating with the midnight playlist, at which point everyone should be dancing.\n\nTotal tracks: 135\n\nLength of all playlists: 8 hours, 7 minutes, and 50 seconds\n\n### Genres\n\n### Artist Network Analysis\n\nExploration notebook: [Spotify Playlist Exploration Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/@ejfox/spotify-playlist-exploration#pmMidnightMusicAllTracks)\n\nExported playlist data with <https://exportify.net/#playlists> found through [reddit through](https://www.reddit.com/r/truespotify/comments/sgqt3n/exportify_export_your_spotify_playlists_to_csv/)\n\nAll songs in a csv <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sz6jrmQml-TKWy9jArsCaGpBdUmonivU1oZ-jTZXu-8/edit?usp=sharing>\n\nGist of the csv <https://gist.github.com/ejfox/deedd43d8b2de49a95016dd47f5c38b8>\n\n## 7PM\n\n<https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3LyfewR3NzcviwZmlSaOOy?si=8996848dd3c94629>\n\n## 8PM\n\n<https://open.spotify.com/playlist/01pW3QTbllu5wl3uPu4q4G?si=87d3944fdbc643b6>\n\n## 9PM\n\n<https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7oyc4KEVAHOS9Z4v8Fo0Dd?si=ef5c5fb81a8b4174>\n\n## 10PM\n\n<https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2lTRaeJ5vA5tShiPLgkVg0?si=4b5592931c1f48b7>\n\n## 11PM\n\n<https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2cwBcpmCi5o3cX3zlDtUVR?si=246dee8ea8df44a5>\n\n## Midnight\n\n<https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4InvNgYsvHIH6kIqZE6fCV?si=e53897693ffa48df>\n"
