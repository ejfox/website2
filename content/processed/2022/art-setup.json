When you know your shit, it's easy to turn any space - big or small - into a place for your transformative ideas to come to life. Here's an insider look at my current setup.\n\n### Get Vibes Right\n\nThe beginning of any worthwhile project is to make sure the atmosphere is just right. Get an adjustable chair, lighting fitted to the task and make sure it's the right temperature. Your art needs the perfect environment to thrive.\n\n### Get Your Supplies\n\nEach type of art requires its own supplies and materials. Think about what you'd like to create and make sure you have everything you need on hand:\n\n- **Acrylic Painting:** Acid-free paper or canvas, paints, brushes, palette and painting mediums.\n- **Watercolor Painting:** Cold press paper, paints, brushes, and palette.\n- **Linocut:** Linocut blocks, carving implements, block printing ink, and block printing tools.\n- **Dyeing:** Soda ash, dye, a container for fabric and dye, and fabric to dye.\n- **Soap:** Soap molds, scale, thermometer, lye, and oils.\n\n### My Setup for Maximum Efficiency\n\nEverything needs to have its place, or else you'll be searching for supplies constantly. Use organizers, bins, trays and racks to keep your materials accessible and organized, it's a payoff that multiplies over time.\n\nMake the space your own, and remember to be patient. Projects like this can bring a lot of satisfaction and inspiration. With the tips in this blog you'll be ready to get the most out of your art studio.\n\n### Travelling art setup\n\nTODO\n\n### Getting Started\n\n- For more info on the studio as a whole and my overall goals: [[the-studio]]\n- For digital art and prototyping: [[2022-prototyping-toolkit]]\n- For garment dying: [[drafts/garment-dying-experiments]]\n- For woodworking: [[woodworking-setup]]\n- For soapmaking [[drafts/soapmaking]]\n"
