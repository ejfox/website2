This is a complex task, because it involves connecting some gear using MIDI, while other gear doesn't even have a MIDI in.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Fortunately, the TR-8, SP-555, and RC-505 have a \"sync\" function, which can be used to send a synth and MIDI clock to other devices. This means that if the TR-8 is playing a consistent beat, the rest of the gear can receive that beat and use it to start automatically looping and recording their tracks. I usually have my RC-505 as master and have the TR-8 sync to whatever tempo it is set at.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"dynamics--crescendos\">Dynamics &#x26; crescendos</h4>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">It's important to leave enough space in a performance to build up from a quiet side to a peak.

It can be used for triggered live samples or as a percussion instrument in a live setting.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The TR-8 is great because you get individual control over the volume and timbre of each drum, so you can easily add or remove just the hi-hats or snare at any time.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"xone-96-mixer\">Xone 96 (Mixer)</h4>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The Xone 96 is a DJ mixer with loads of inputs and fx, but where it shines is as the center for audio controls for all inputs.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"delay-and-reverb-pedals-effects\">Delay and reverb pedals (effects)</h4>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">At least one delay and one reverb pedal on loop make any performance infinitely better. The DD-7 and DD-3 have different delay times and sound, so they make a great pair in my opinion.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"traktor-f1-sampler\">Traktor F1 (Sampler)</h4>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The F1 is NI's controller for the Traktor DJ software. It's a limited sampler with 4 slots, but it's useful in a live looping setup due to it's ease of use during a performance.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In the context of live looping rhythm, the knobs correspond to decay, filter cutoff and other performance oriented controls.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"sp-555-fx\">SP-555 (FX)</h4>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In my opinion, the SP-555 is the definitive looping sample player. It's a classic, the one where it all started. It's somewhat confusing interface is eclipsed by its usefulness as a looping tool. The library of loops and samples available for these devices is second to none, and so are their warm saturating sounds.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"midifighter-controller\">Midifighter (Controller)</h4>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The Midifighter is a controller that is designed to perform samples in a live setting.
