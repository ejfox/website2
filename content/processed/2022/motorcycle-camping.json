For instance, if you’ll need to check into a hotel during your trip, you may want to leave your camping gear behind while bringing smaller essentials such as clothing and electronics up to your room. Or, if you plan on meeting up with friends and traveling by boat, what do you leave behind on the bike and what do you bring along to camp? These are questions that can be answered with thoughtful packing strategies and are better addressed ahead of time so you can grab your bags and focus on your adventure.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Consider using dry bags clipped together or attached to your bags with carabiners so everything stays together no matter what kind of terrain or weather follows you on your journey.</p>\n<img src=\"F5B356FA-79CC-4139-8F70-162F31D045F9_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"My bags for Island camping at Lake George\" class=\"w-full max-w-full mx-auto transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out pr-2 py-2 md:pr-6 md:py-4 lg:pr-12 lg:py-6 animate-on-scroll slide-from-bottom will-change-transform\">\n<blockquote class=\"prose-blockquote prose-sm max-w-prose pl-4 border-l-4 border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 italic my-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300 animate-on-scroll slide-from-left\">\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">You see things vacationing on a motorcycle in a way that is completely different from any other.
