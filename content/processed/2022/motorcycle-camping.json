The same sensory connection to the world we get from motorcycling—the same elements we love, of being in the wind and leaning through the curves—can take place around camp. This both adds to your motorcycle adventures and contributes an entirely new passion to the mix.\n>Tim Collins and Amanda Zito [Collins-Zito-The Fundamentals of Motorcycle Camping](Collins-Zito-The%20Fundamentals%20of%20Motorcycle%20Camping.md)\n\n### Modular Design\n\nLet's start by talking about how to stay organized on the road. There will come a time when you need something you packed but don't remember where it is or what bag its in.\n\nTo help avoid confusion, lay out your gear before you head out and get in the habit of labeling bags or containers so you can find them when needed. Everything should have precisely one place where it belongs. You should be able to envision that place in your mind’s eye and find it in the dark.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1691608713/Screenshot_2023-08-09_at_3.17.33_PM.png)\n\nStart by packing all of your gear into tiers; with essential items within easiest reach - this way, you won't have to fumble around for them when you need them.\n\nIn certain scenarios, it might be helpful to pull off subsets of your bags. For instance, if you’ll need to check into a hotel during your trip, you may want to leave your camping gear behind while bringing smaller essentials such as clothing and electronics up to your room. Or, if you plan on meeting up with friends and traveling by boat, what do you leave behind on the bike and what do you bring along to camp? These are questions that can be answered with thoughtful packing strategies and are better addressed ahead of time so you can grab your bags and focus on your adventure.\n\nConsider using dry bags clipped together or attached to your bags with carabiners so everything stays together no matter what kind of terrain or weather follows you on your journey.\n\n![My bags for Island camping at Lake George](F5B356FA-79CC-4139-8F70-162F31D045F9_1_105_c.jpeg)\n\n>You see things vacationing on a motorcycle in a way that is completely different from any other. In a car you’re always in a compartment, and because you’re used to it you don’t realize that through that car window everything you see is just more TV. You’re a passive observer and it is all moving by you boringly in a frame.\n>[Pirsig-Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](Pirsig-Zen%20and%20the%20Art%20of%20Motorcycle%20Maintenance.md)\n\n### Motorcycle: Kawasaki Versys-X 300\n\nYour bike is one of the most important elements of a successful camping trip, after your own body. You need a model that’s powerful enough to handle off-road terrain, yet lightweight enough to pick up when you inevitably drop it. It should have plenty of luggage capacity - able to carry all of your essential gear comfortably between destinations.\n\nThe Kawasaki Versys X 300 fits all my requirements.\n\n- Engine: 296cc liquid-cooled 4-stroke DOHC 8-valve parallel twin.\n- Power: 40 HP @ 11,500 rpm.\n- Torque: 19.2 lb-ft of torque @ 10,000 rpm.\n- Curb Weight: 386 lbs (175 kg)\n- Seat Height: 32.1 in (815mm)\n\n![](ADD924AF-D7C4-4F8B-ABD9-4D7EB4EBF026.jpeg)\n\n#### What I looked for in a bike\n- Weight: I need to be able to pick it up and take it on single track\n- Tires: It needs to be able to go off road\n- Luggage: It needs to be able to carry all my camping gear\n\n### Gearing Up\n\nFinding the right protective gear is as important as getting your motorcycle. Make sure you have a helmet that fits correctly, gloves, jacket and boots that are designed with safety and comfort in mind. You want to be thinking about your adventure, not your gear. A little investment goes a long way.\n\nMy setup:\n\n- Helmet: Bell Racer\n- Gloves: Knox Handroid Gauntlets\n- Jacket: Halo Drystar\n- Boots: Forma ADV\n- GPS: Garmin Zumo XT\n\n![](6986CDD3-930A-410E-9300-40BD7751A357_1_105_c.jpeg)\n\n### Gear Up Your Motorcycle\n\nIt’s just as important to your gear up your motorcycle as it is to gear up yourself. You’ll need a variety of bags, depending on the length of your trips. Having an excuse to have a variety of bags may be one of my favorite reasons to travel.\n\nWith a system like the [Mosko Moto Reckless 80L Motorcycle Luggage System](https://moskomoto.com/products/reckless-80l) you have a main bag, two 25L side bags and two 4L auxiliary bags for maximum organization. Look for bags with durable material, waterproof construction and straps to keep your things secure.\n\nYou should be prepared to ride in the rain. It will happen at the most inopportune time, so all of your gear should be able to get wet along with you. Your main bag should include a dry bags for at least clothing and a first aid kit, while your side dry bags and auxiliary bags should house your camping gear such as a tent, hammock, sleeping bag, liner and pillow.\n\nI also carry an art kit and a Jetboil with fuel for coffee in the morning.\n\n![This is definitely Too Much Stuff, but she handled it like a champ](EBF62C4D-364E-44F2-9486-691705B62C8A_1_105_c.jpeg)\n\n### Bags\n- Main bag: 5.11 Rush 24\n\t- Dry bag for clothes\n\t- First aid kit\n\t- Art kit\n- 25L side bag 1: tent, hammock\n- 25L side bag 2: sleeping bag, liner, pillow, pad\n- 4l aux bag 1: jetboil + fuel\n\n*exploded bags diagram*\n\n[Mosko Moto Reckless 80L Motorcycle Luggage System](https://moskomoto.com/products/reckless-80l)\n\n#### How to find anything (what bag is it in?)\n\nAnother reason I lay out all my gear is so that I can remember what I brought or even look it up later if I forget that I had something useful but didn't bring it out until the end of the trip. Staying organized helps make sure that I know where my items are located and how many of each item exist so that nothing gets lost or forgotten about when packing up after camping somewhere new!\n\n### Camping\n\nIt helps if you already have a camping setup from backpacking or car camping. Camping off a motorcycle requires finding gear that can be condensed down to the smallest possible form. Space on the bike is precious and every square inch considered carefully.\n\nI love the Marmot Tungsten 2P Tent—a lightweight but versatile option that sets up quick, though it is a bit large for my liking.\n\n[Marmot Tungsten 2P Tent](https://www.rei.com/product/110883/marmot-tungsten-2p-tent-with-footprint)\n\n![](IMG_0010.jpeg)\n\n### Campsite Considerations\n\nCamping off a motorcycle requires finding gear that can be condensed down to the smallest possible form. Look for items with versatile features and lightweight construction and consider your space limitations when selecting items. We love the Marmot Tungsten 2P Tent - a lightweight but versatile option.\n\n![](E1730FDB-741A-4788-AB0E-767EF47B3D63_1_105_c.jpeg)\n\nYou should also consider a campsite layout to help keep your gear safe and organized while still giving you plenty of space to explore. Take a look at our diagram below to get an idea of how you can setup your campsite for maximum enjoyment and convenience.\n\n### Motorcycle repair kit (home + travel)\n\nBecause no matter how much research and preparation goes into a journey there are still moments when things will go wrong; having an emergency repair kit can help ensure that a small issue doesn't derail your trip entirely! Better to have it and not use it, than to need it and not have it!\n\n#### Home repair kit\n- Socket set 4mm-19mm\n- Combination wrenches 8mm-19mm\n- Pliers\n- Hex wrenches 2-10mm\n- Adjustable wrench\n- Allen wrench set\n- Torx wrenches\n- Spark plugs, 10mm thread, 0.75in\n#### Travel repair kit\n- Tubeless tire repair kit\n- Mini tire inflator\n- Jump battery\n\n### Ready to explore\n\nNow that you’ve got your gear and a plan in place, it’s time to start your journey! Even with the best-laid plans, things can still go wrong on the trail, and that’s all part of the fun.\n\nIf you live in the Hudson Valley, check out [[hudson-valley-motorcycle-rides]] for some great spots to explore.
