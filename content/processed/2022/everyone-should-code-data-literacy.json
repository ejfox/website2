The best way to learn is to accomplish a task that provides a function beyond the sheer learning itself. Some of the first computer networks and mailing lists were used to trade recordings of Grateful Dead shows. In this same vein, a student who wants to track baseball scores or their anime library or create a website for their album will learn the fundamentals as their project progresses naturally.\n\nIt is not remembering the name of obscure tools, functions, or frameworks.\n\n[[drafts/approach-to-learning]]\n\n### Learning to google “Magic Words”\n\nOnce you know what something is called, you can usually find enough resources to understand it, and maybe even a few examples of how to use it. The difficult thing, often described as “domain expertise” is knowing what things are called in a particular industry, field, or tool.\n\nSo there is a meta-skill that sits on top of learning any technology; if you can reliably discover and research the “magic words” you need, you can teach yourself almost anything as a result.\n\n### Noticing when you feel like a robot\n\nSometimes I will find myself doing an arduous and repetitive task. When I find myself repeating a loop of tasks more than a few times, I sit back and think how long it would take to automate that task. Then I think about how many times I will probably do that task by hand, and weigh those things together. If I can save time by writing some code to make it faster, I almost always will. This type of broken brain is called being a hacker.\n\n### Communicating with Artificial Intelligence\n\nSee [[how-i-use-gpt3]] and [[how-i-use-stable-diffusion]] for more.\n\n### Appreciating the “I can do that” moments\n\nThere is a profound feeling that comes with the realization that you can make a computer do what you want it to. It’s like a lightbulb moment, and it’s addicting.\n\nYou start to see automation possibilities everywhere. You can make a computer do the things that are tedious, repetitive, or just plain annoying. This is the skill that allows you to take a problem and break it down into small, manageable pieces that a computer can understand.\n\n### Control of the world around you\n\nWith coding, you have the ability to define the world around you. In a very real sense, you can make the world work the way you want it to.\n\nOf course, you can’t do everything, but the ability to code gives you a lot of power to shape the world to your liking. [[the-internet-was-built-to-be-hacked]]\n\n### Making your work easier\n\nCoding can make your work easier in all sorts of ways. Automating repetitive tasks, for example, can save you a lot of time and effort.\n\nBut coding can also make your work easier in more subtle ways. For example, learning to code can help you become more organized and systematic in your thinking. This can make it easier to solve problems and to communicate your ideas to others.\n\n### Improving your career prospects\n\nCoding skills are in high demand. Or they can help you start your own business. If you have an idea for a new app or website, you can bring it to life yourself.\n\n### Having a set of tools that are ready\n\nOnce you have learned to code, you have a set of tools at your disposal that can be utilized for a wide range of tasks. From data analysis to web development, the possibilities are endless.\n\nFrom there you can build a computer setup (like [[computer-setup]]) that has your tools ready to go for when you get an idea for a project.\n"
