However, Joy-Driven Development prioritizes both the experience of those working on the project and the quality of the final product. We focus on enjoying our work so <em>we can create better work</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">There are times when you need to do your chores, and that is not always fun. But having all of your chores done is joyful. Making a client happy is joyful. Creating work that makes the world better is joyful. If you can remember that as you hand-clean a dataset or debug a complicated SQL query, you can find the joy in those tasks too. Joy-driven development doesn't mean that we only do work that brings us joy, it means that joy is the gas that powers the engine.</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">By entwining threads of joy into the fabric of our work, we not only cultivate more satisfying experiences for ourselves but also craft joy-filled creations that resonate with users.</p>"
