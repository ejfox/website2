If they are physical; they must be gifted, sold, or thrown away. The space those things take up is more valuable when it is empty- the emptiness leaves space to create more.

A data schema is not data. As data visualizers, we need data in order to do our jobs. All of the data. Actually, more data than you actually want to see. It is often very tempting to break this rule; don't do it. Work cannot start until the data is in-hand.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"we-always-label-our-layers-and-files-with-care\">We always label our layers and files with care</h4>\n<p class=\"\">When working in Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects, Figma, or any other tool that allows you to name layers as you work. Take the time to label the layers. Do not hold yourself to a high standard for names. You don't need a deep organization system, and you may need to change the name later, but any name is better than no name.</p>\n<p class=\"\">When naming a file or variable, take a second to think of how it could be confused, what makes that thing unique, and how someone with zero context would understand the name. Nothing should be named \"data\", for example.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Names should be based on what a thing accomplishes- not what it looks like. \"Background\", not \"red square\". \"Home Button\", not \"rounded rectangle 1\" - that way names will still be applicable through multiple versions, iterations, and styles.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"we-always-test\">We always test</h4>\n<p class=\"\">A good portion of doing the work is testing that the work… works. We are not done until it is tested in the usual ways. Then the unusual ways. The testing helps us work fast, knowing that we will catch any side effects later. When the deadline is reduced, it means we build less and test the same amount. Testing cannot be a victim to the deadline.</p>",

We must not be precious about these things. When they are digital, they can be luckily filed away on some server somewhere and recalled later. If they are physical; they must be gifted, sold, or thrown away. The space those things take up is more valuable when it is empty- the emptiness leaves space to create more. Because of this, we must gleefully rid ourselves of our previous work, before we grow to hate it, or even worse.</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"appendix-brass-tacks-etcetera\">Appendix, brass tacks, etcetera</h3>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"we-have-data-in-hand-before-we-start-data-driven-projects\">We have data in hand before we start data-driven projects</h4>\n<p class=\"\">The promise of data is not data. A data schema is not data. As data visualizers, we need data in order to do our jobs. All of the data. Actually, more data than you actually want to see. It is often very tempting to break this rule; don't do it. Work cannot start until the data is in-hand.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"we-always-label-our-layers-and-files-with-care\">We always label our layers and files with care</h4>\n<p class=\"\">When working in Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects, Figma, or any other tool that allows you to name layers as you work. Take the time to label the layers. Do not hold yourself to a high standard for names. You don't need a deep organization system, and you may need to change the name later, but any name is better than no name.</p>\n<p class=\"\">When naming a file or variable, take a second to think of how it could be confused, what makes that thing unique, and how someone with zero context would understand the name. Nothing should be named \"data\", for example.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Names should be based on what a thing accomplishes- not what it looks like. \"Background\", not \"red square\". \"Home Button\", not \"rounded rectangle 1\" - that way names will still be applicable through multiple versions, iterations, and styles.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"we-always-test\">We always test</h4>\n<p class=\"\">A good portion of doing the work is testing that the work… works. We are not done until it is tested in the usual ways. Then the unusual ways. The testing helps us work fast, knowing that we will catch any side effects later. When the deadline is reduced, it means we build less and test the same amount. Testing cannot be a victim to the deadline.</p>",
