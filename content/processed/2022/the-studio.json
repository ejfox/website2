Know which stage of a project you are in, and speak it aloud. Complete a first draft before you edit what you have written. Get a perfect 8 bar loop for the chorus before you arrange the song.

There is wisdom in this that all of the agreements tie back to: get momentum and make the work. Even if you hate the first draft, treat it like a warm-up and a loosening of muscles. Your reward for finishing your work is more work, where you can do it better.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"6-we-follow-the-templates-and-protocols\">6.

That should be understood in every detail of the studio. The DNA of the studio is in the tools chosen, the absence of the tools that were not chosen, and the magic of limitations. If a color is missing; no, it's not. That is a limitation that was designed to push our creativity in one direction or another, often with intentionality.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">We treat each other with respect and kindness.

But that improvement must be done, with intention, in \"studio improvement\" time, not \"be creative\" time. Time in the studio should be used creating work. Life is short, use the templates and protocols.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"7-we-ask-for-what-we-need\">7.

We do not keep secrets</h4>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">We do not keep secrets from each other, ourselves, or the outer world. Nothing we do is precious enough to keep secrets about. None of our techniques need to be hidden. We know the power of sharing our work with the world, and the inumerable benefits that come from giving openly to anyone who asks.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"10-we-throw-things-out\">10. We throw things out</h4>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Because we experiment, by nature we go down paths that do not aid our goals. This means that we often create things we don't actually want. We must not be precious about these things. When they are digital, they can be luckily filed away on some server somewhere and recalled later. If they are physical; they must be gifted, sold, or thrown away. The space those things take up is more valuable when it is empty- the emptiness leaves space to create more. Because of this, we must gleefully rid ourselves of our previous work, before we grow to hate it, or even worse.</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<h3 class=\"prose-lg text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose md:pr-12 animate-on-scroll slide-from-left\" id=\"appendix-brass-tacks-etcetera\">Appendix, brass tacks, etcetera</h3>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"we-have-data-in-hand-before-we-start-data-driven-projects\">We have data in hand before we start data-driven projects</h4>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">The promise of data is not data.
