Greek yogurt is high in protein, which will keep you full for longer and provide energy throughout the day. Granola is a great source of complex carbohydrates, which will give you sustained energy and help you stay alert and focused.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"oatmeal--granola\">Oatmeal &#x26; Granola</h4>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Oatmeal and granola is a delicious and healthy breakfast option. Oatmeal is a great source of complex carbohydrates and fiber, which will give you sustained energy and keep you full until lunchtime. Granola adds a crunchy texture and a boost of protein and healthy fats.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"toast--greek-yogurt\">Toast &#x26; Greek Yogurt</h4>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">I first had this at the Samovar Lounge in Yerba Buena Park. It was simple and yet extraordinarily delicious and decadent: a thick slice of sourdough with fresh, thick greek yogurt, topped with honey, olive oil, and big flakes of sea salt. It is a simple and luxurious breakfast.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"eggs--toast\">Eggs &#x26; Toast</h4>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Eggs and toast is a classic breakfast combination that is quick, tasty, and nutritious. Eggs are a great source of protein, while the toast provides complex carbohydrates for sustained energy. I usually add some hot sauce or chili oil.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"hardboiled-eggs\">Hardboiled Eggs</h4>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Hardboiled eggs are a great breakfast option if you're short on time or donâ€™t want to make dishes. They're a great source of protein and can be eaten alone or paired with toast or a piece of fruit. Hardboiled eggs can also be pre-cooked on the weekend and stored in the fridge for a quick and easy breakfast during the week.</p>\n<h3 class=\"prose-lg text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose md:pr-12 animate-on-scroll slide-from-left\" id=\"lunch\">Lunch</h3>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Lunch is an important meal of the day and should include a balance of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats.
