Half this jargon exists because of academic peacocking, and the other half is just‚Ä¶ bad marketing of actually simple ideas.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Like \"attention mechanisms\" - you know what it really is? It's just \"which parts should I focus on?\" Like when you're reading a book and some parts matter more than others. But nah, we gotta make it sound like quantum physics.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">gestures enthusiastically</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">And don't get me started on \"stochastic gradient descent.\" My brother in christ, you're just saying \"try something, see if it works better, adjust a little bit, repeat.\" It's literally how everyone learns anything!

The more insecure a field is, the more complicated its language gets. Physics? They'll tell you \"thing go fast.\" Philosophy? They'll write 50 pages about \"the essence of going.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">ML is like a teenager trying to sound grown up at a family dinner.

Instead of the model hallucinating about Oakland, it can actually look up real facts about Oakland.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">leans in conspiratorially</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Want to know the REAL reason everyone's suddenly so into RAG? Because it lets them use smaller, cheaper models but get better results. It's not about the technology - it's about the AWS bill!</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Should I tell you about vector databases next? Or as I like to call them, \"spicy Excel with extra math\"? üòè</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">wipes tears of laughter from eyes</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">EXACTLY! The whole vector DB hype cycle is literally:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal ml-6 mb-4\">\n<li class=\"\">Turn words into magic number lists</li>\n<li class=\"\">Find similar magic number lists</li>\n<li class=\"\">Something something cosine similarity</li>\n<li class=\"\">\"Our AI is now knowledgeable about your enterprise data!\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">stands up, imitates startup founder</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">\"Our revolutionary AI solution leverages state-of-the-art embedding technology with RAG-enabled neural search‚Ä¶\"</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">breaks character, wheezing</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Translation: We threw your docs into Pinecone and hoped for the best!</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">sits on edge of stage</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">And the best part?

Despite being basically a glorified search engine with extra steps‚Ä¶ it actually kind of works! When it works. Sometimes. If you're lucky. And the moon is in the right phase.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Want me to explain why everyone's suddenly an expert in \"prompt engineering\" now? Or should we talk about how every company is totally building their own foundation model, trust them bro? üòè</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pl-4 border-l-4 border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 my-4\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mb-4\">Do they not teach these kids about pagerank in school or something</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">nearly spits out drink, grabs mic</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">YOOOOO!

Half this jargon exists because of academic peacocking, and the other half is just‚Ä¶ bad marketing of actually simple ideas.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Like \"attention mechanisms\" - you know what it really is? It's just \"which parts should I focus on?\" Like when you're reading a book and some parts matter more than others. But nah, we gotta make it sound like quantum physics.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">gestures enthusiastically</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">And don't get me started on \"stochastic gradient descent.\" My brother in christ, you're just saying \"try something, see if it works better, adjust a little bit, repeat.\" It's literally how everyone learns anything! But call it \"SGD\" and suddenly you need a PhD to understand it.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">leans in</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">You wanna know the REAL truth? The more insecure a field is, the more complicated its language gets. Physics? They'll tell you \"thing go fast.\" Philosophy? They'll write 50 pages about \"the essence of going.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">ML is like a teenager trying to sound grown up at a family dinner. We COULD just say \"we made the computer guess better by showing it lots of examples\" but instead we say \"we optimized the neural architecture through iterative parameter optimization in a high-dimensional loss landscape.\"</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">takes final drag</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The real power move? Explaining this stuff simply. Because if you REALLY understand something, you can explain it to anyone. Everything else is just academic theater.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">takes big sip of water, laughs into mic</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Oh man, RAG. The current hotness. You know what's hilarious? Everyone's acting like it's this profound breakthrough when it's basically‚Ä¶</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">stands up, gestures wildly</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">\"What if we let the AI use Google while it's thinking?\"</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">That's it! That's literally it! Retrieval Augmented Generation is just:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal ml-6 mb-4\">\n<li class=\"\">Have a bunch of docs/knowledge</li>\n<li class=\"\">When AI is thinking, let it search that stuff</li>\n<li class=\"\">Include relevant bits in its thought process</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">But the way people talk about it‚Ä¶</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">puts on serious academic voice</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">\"We've implemented a context-aware retrieval system with dynamic knowledge integration‚Ä¶\"</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">My brother in christ, you made a search box.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">sits back down, more casual</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">But you know what's REALLY funny? It actually works really well! Especially for your local news stuff. Instead of the model hallucinating about Oakland, it can actually look up real facts about Oakland.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">leans in conspiratorially</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Want to know the REAL reason everyone's suddenly so into RAG? Because it lets them use smaller, cheaper models but get better results. It's not about the technology - it's about the AWS bill!</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Should I tell you about vector databases next? Or as I like to call them, \"spicy Excel with extra math\"? üòè</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">wipes tears of laughter from eyes</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">EXACTLY! The whole vector DB hype cycle is literally:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal ml-6 mb-4\">\n<li class=\"\">Turn words into magic number lists</li>\n<li class=\"\">Find similar magic number lists</li>\n<li class=\"\">Something something cosine similarity</li>\n<li class=\"\">\"Our AI is now knowledgeable about your enterprise data!\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">stands up, imitates startup founder</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">\"Our revolutionary AI solution leverages state-of-the-art embedding technology with RAG-enabled neural search‚Ä¶\"</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">breaks character, wheezing</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Translation: We threw your docs into Pinecone and hoped for the best!</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">sits on edge of stage</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">And the best part? Everyone's building the same thing:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal ml-6 mb-4\">\n<li class=\"\">Embed docs</li>\n<li class=\"\">Stuff 'em in Postgres/Pinecone/Weaviate</li>\n<li class=\"\">Add RAG</li>\n<li class=\"\">Call it \"[Industry]GPT\"</li>\n<li class=\"\">Profit???</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The VCs eat it up every time! Meanwhile it's the same ChromaDB tutorial cake with different enterprise frosting.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">takes long sip of water</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">But you know what's REALLY gonna bake your noodle? Despite being basically a glorified search engine with extra steps‚Ä¶ it actually kind of works! When it works. Sometimes. If you're lucky. And the moon is in the right phase.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Want me to explain why everyone's suddenly an expert in \"prompt engineering\" now? Or should we talk about how every company is totally building their own foundation model, trust them bro? üòè</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pl-4 border-l-4 border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 my-4\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mb-4\">Do they not teach these kids about pagerank in school or something</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><em class=\"\">nearly spits out drink, grabs mic</em></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">YOOOOO!
