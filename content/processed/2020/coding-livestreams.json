I do my <a href=\"https://ejfox.com/blog/step-zero/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">mise en place</a> and get all my ingredients sliced and diced in the right proportions.

It is really motivating to have people helping you along in your journey. It makes it feel like you are with a group of people solving interesting problems together (which reminds me of my favorite moments when working at start-ups).</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">You also get a record of the decisions you made, which I have used on more than one occasion to remind myself why I did something a certain way.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"livestream-experiments\">Livestream experiments</h3>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"live-animation\">Live animation</h4>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">One time, Ian and I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrejfox/status/1302420672409415681\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">turned ourselves into animated characters<svg class=\"inline-block w-4 h-4 ml-1 opacity-50 dark:opacity-75 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity align-text-bottom\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"1em\" height=\"1em\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M21.543 7.104c.015.211.015.423.015.636c0 6.507-4.954 14.01-14.01 14.01v-.003A13.94 13.94 0 0 1 0 19.539a9.88 9.88 0 0 0 7.287-2.041a4.93 4.93 0 0 1-4.6-3.42a4.9 4.9 0 0 0 2.223-.084A4.926 4.926 0 0 1 .96 9.167v-.062a4.9 4.9 0 0 0 2.235.616A4.93 4.93 0 0 1 1.67 3.148a13.98 13.98 0 0 0 10.15 5.144a4.929 4.929 0 0 1 8.39-4.49a9.9 9.9 0 0 0 3.128-1.196a4.94 4.94 0 0 1-2.165 2.724A9.8 9.8 0 0 0 24 4.555a10 10 0 0 1-2.457 2.549\" class=\"\"></path></svg></a> using <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Va3_e-4bKE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Adobe Character Animator<svg class=\"inline-block w-4 h-4 ml-1 opacity-50 dark:opacity-75 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity align-text-bottom\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"1em\" height=\"1em\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M23.498 6.186a3.02 3.02 0 0 0-2.122-2.136C19.505 3.545 12 3.545 12 3.545s-7.505 0-9.377.505A3.02 3.02 0 0 0 .502 6.186C0 8.07 0 12 0 12s0 3.93.502 5.814a3.02 3.02 0 0 0 2.122 2.136c1.871.505 9.376.505 9.376.505s7.505 0 9.377-.505a3.02 3.02 0 0 0 2.122-2.136C24 15.93 24 12 24 12s0-3.93-.502-5.814M9.545 15.568V8.432L15.818 12z\" class=\"\"></path></svg></a>.

I also really enjoy the parameters of collaboration we have set. A malicious troll could potentially make the colors all white, or something, but even that is interesting.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">What they can't do is edit our color palette in a way that ends up with us saying something racist, misogynist, or otherwise unwanted on our stream.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Letting the crowd control the colors has been such a rewarding and risk-free way to let the users interact with us directly and see the changes they are making in real time on the stream (when the background is showing).</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"building-the-habit\">Building the habit</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">One of the best parts about doing the livestream with Ian is that we can hold each other accountable. Skipping a stream also means letting your friend down. As a result of this, the only streams we have missed happened when Ian had to move his entire family across the country from California to Florida in the middle of a pandemic.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">We do our streams on Sunday and Monday evenings every week, the repetition has been the key to figuring things out. Different technical and graphical elements emerged as we found that we needed them. We went through the occasional technical hiccup on air. We did a lot of streaming to 1 or 2 viewers and figuring out how pre-produce the shows, pace ourselves, estimate how long different tasks would take, and know when to move on when something was going more slowly than expected.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"surprisingly-productive\">Surprisingly productive</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">One of the most surprising things of working in the open is that I feel like every time we stream we are surprisingly productive. <em class=\"\">There is something unique about \"performing\" your job to the internet.</em> We usually stream for 3 hours and take a little 10-15 break in the middle. I rarely get that sort of consistently focused time in my private life. Because of that, I find myself waking up the morning after a livestream and looking at all the things that we created in astonishment.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\"We did all that?\" I ask myself, but of course we did, it's all on video.</p>",

It is really motivating to have people helping you along in your journey. It makes it feel like you are with a group of people solving interesting problems together (which reminds me of my favorite moments when working at start-ups).</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">You also get a record of the decisions you made, which I have used on more than one occasion to remind myself why I did something a certain way.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"livestream-experiments\">Livestream experiments</h3>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"live-animation\">Live animation</h4>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">One time, Ian and I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrejfox/status/1302420672409415681\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">turned ourselves into animated characters<svg class=\"inline-block w-4 h-4 ml-1 opacity-50 dark:opacity-75 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity align-text-bottom\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"1em\" height=\"1em\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M21.543 7.104c.015.211.015.423.015.636c0 6.507-4.954 14.01-14.01 14.01v-.003A13.94 13.94 0 0 1 0 19.539a9.88 9.88 0 0 0 7.287-2.041a4.93 4.93 0 0 1-4.6-3.42a4.9 4.9 0 0 0 2.223-.084A4.926 4.926 0 0 1 .96 9.167v-.062a4.9 4.9 0 0 0 2.235.616A4.93 4.93 0 0 1 1.67 3.148a13.98 13.98 0 0 0 10.15 5.144a4.929 4.929 0 0 1 8.39-4.49a9.9 9.9 0 0 0 3.128-1.196a4.94 4.94 0 0 1-2.165 2.724A9.8 9.8 0 0 0 24 4.555a10 10 0 0 1-2.457 2.549\" class=\"\"></path></svg></a> using <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Va3_e-4bKE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Adobe Character Animator<svg class=\"inline-block w-4 h-4 ml-1 opacity-50 dark:opacity-75 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity align-text-bottom\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"1em\" height=\"1em\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M23.498 6.186a3.02 3.02 0 0 0-2.122-2.136C19.505 3.545 12 3.545 12 3.545s-7.505 0-9.377.505A3.02 3.02 0 0 0 .502 6.186C0 8.07 0 12 0 12s0 3.93.502 5.814a3.02 3.02 0 0 0 2.122 2.136c1.871.505 9.376.505 9.376.505s7.505 0 9.377-.505a3.02 3.02 0 0 0 2.122-2.136C24 15.93 24 12 24 12s0-3.93-.502-5.814M9.545 15.568V8.432L15.818 12z\" class=\"\"></path></svg></a>.

I am imagining some way of putting a bunch of screenshots on a shared table, going over them together. Then, in the virtual space, we might go to our \"laptops\" and start live coding. Our outputs are displayed in the virtual world on enormous screens (or floating in space, if 3D), and users can join in and explore them and offer feedback.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"crowd-participation-through-firebase\">Crowd participation through Firebase</h4>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Ian created <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@codingwithfire/coding-with-doom-fire\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">a notebook<svg class=\"inline-block w-4 h-4 ml-1 opacity-50 dark:opacity-75 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity align-text-bottom\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"1em\" height=\"1em\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M12 20q-1.597 0-2.77-.696a4.7 4.7 0 0 1-1.794-1.89a10 10 0 0 1-.916-2.53A13.6 13.6 0 0 1 6.23 12q0-1.149.152-2.2q.15-1.049.556-2.132A6.8 6.8 0 0 1 7.98 5.79a4.7 4.7 0 0 1 1.668-1.293Q10.681 4 12 4q1.597 0 2.77.696a4.7 4.7 0 0 1 1.794 1.89q.627 1.193.916 2.53T17.77 12q0 1.149-.152 2.2a9.8 9.8 0 0 1-.567 2.132a7.2 7.2 0 0 1-1.042 1.878q-.627.796-1.657 1.293q-1.031.498-2.352.497m2.037-5.882c.551-.554.858-1.32.848-2.118q0-1.236-.827-2.118Q13.23 9 12 9t-2.058.882A3 3 0 0 0 9.115 12q0 1.236.827 2.118Q10.77 15 12 15t2.037-.882M12 24c6.372 0 11.538-5.373 11.538-12S18.372 0 12 0S.462 5.373.462 12S5.628 24 12 24\" class=\"\"></path></svg></a> that uses Firebase and a real-time database so that anyone can edit the colors that appear behind us live on stream.

I also really enjoy the parameters of collaboration we have set. A malicious troll could potentially make the colors all white, or something, but even that is interesting.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">What they can't do is edit our color palette in a way that ends up with us saying something racist, misogynist, or otherwise unwanted on our stream.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Letting the crowd control the colors has been such a rewarding and risk-free way to let the users interact with us directly and see the changes they are making in real time on the stream (when the background is showing).</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"building-the-habit\">Building the habit</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">One of the best parts about doing the livestream with Ian is that we can hold each other accountable. Skipping a stream also means letting your friend down. As a result of this, the only streams we have missed happened when Ian had to move his entire family across the country from California to Florida in the middle of a pandemic.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">We do our streams on Sunday and Monday evenings every week, the repetition has been the key to figuring things out. Different technical and graphical elements emerged as we found that we needed them. We went through the occasional technical hiccup on air. We did a lot of streaming to 1 or 2 viewers and figuring out how pre-produce the shows, pace ourselves, estimate how long different tasks would take, and know when to move on when something was going more slowly than expected.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"surprisingly-productive\">Surprisingly productive</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">One of the most surprising things of working in the open is that I feel like every time we stream we are surprisingly productive. <em class=\"\">There is something unique about \"performing\" your job to the internet.</em> We usually stream for 3 hours and take a little 10-15 break in the middle. I rarely get that sort of consistently focused time in my private life. Because of that, I find myself waking up the morning after a livestream and looking at all the things that we created in astonishment.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\"We did all that?\" I ask myself, but of course we did, it's all on video.</p>",
