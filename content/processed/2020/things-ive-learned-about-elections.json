Votes are cast and tallied by a wide variety of Americans who all have the same goal but often different ideas about how to go about it. Votes are cast in cities and rural areas, in places with millions of constituents or dozens. Many elections are run locally by someone you should mentally picture as your well-meaning aunt. The sheer scale of such an operation is astounding. We live in a country that spans a continent and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US-Timezones-post-2007.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">9 time zones</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"\">This great country contains lots of different people with lots of different ways of going about things.</p>\n<p class=\"\">The basic rules around voting are laid out in the constitution^[<a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/articles/article-i#elections-clause\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Article 1 of the Constitution</a> “The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States…” - <a href=\"https://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec4.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Section 4</a>: “The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.”] but a remarkable amount of the nitty-gritty details are <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/voting-laws-roundup-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">left up to each state</a> to figure out.</p>\n<p class=\"\">On election day in America, polls open at a particular time and close at a particular time. Those times, like almost everything else, <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/State_Poll_Opening_and_Closing_Times_(2019)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">depend on where you’re talking about</a> and can vary even within a single state and could change any year.</p>\n<p class=\"\">We have grown accustomed to live results of elections. This is definitely not something our grandfathers had and is mind-bogglingly complex once you start to think about it.</p>\n<p class=\"\">With American elections “live” does not mean getting the results of votes immediately after they are cast. The closest we can get for now is seeing vote results as they are counted after polls close. ^[This makes sense, when you think about it. There is reason to believe if you could turn on your TV and see how your candidate was doing, if you could see the vote counts live and your candidate was safely ahead, you might decide it’s not even worth going out and casting a vote.]</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"races\">Races</h3>\n<p class=\"\">Any particular office (be it a Senate or a President or local Sheriff) has a variety of candidates from a variety of parties.

They also expected that senators elected by state legislatures would be freed from pressures of public opinion and therefore better able to concentrate on legislative business and serve the needs of each state.

House districts are only colored for a particular party when that race has been called (not projected) by the NBC decision desk. This means there is basically no chance it will ever change color. Counties, on the other hand, never technically have a “winner” but a “leader” who has a majority of votes in a particular county. Counties were colored by whoever was leading the votes.

Wednesday was also not an option, because it was market day, and farmers wouldn’t be able to make it to the polls. So it was decided that Tuesday would be the day that Americans would vote in elections, and in 1845, Congress passed a law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"resources\">Resources</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc\">\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Ballotpedia</a> is an exceptional source of all of the strange little constantly-changing details about elections, --freely editable like Wikipedia-- edited by <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Ballotpedia:Staff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Ballotpedia staff</a>.</li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"https://github.com/nvkelso/election-geodata\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">election-geodata</a> is a great collection of geographic precinct shape data for mapping election results.</li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.openelections.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">OpenElections</a> is an open-source project made to create a “free, comprehensive, standardized, linked set of election data for the United States, including federal and statewide offices” which is a pretty incredible goal if you ask me.</li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">270toWin</a> has great maps and information on historical elections.</li>\n</ul>",
