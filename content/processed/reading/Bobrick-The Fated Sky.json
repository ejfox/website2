That sounds perfectly sensible to us, because Edmund’s point of view is the respectable one today. But to Lear the disparate characters of his three daughters can only be explained by the astrological distinctions at their birth. “It is the stars / The stars above us,” he cries, “govern our conditions; / Else one self mate and make could not beget / Such different issues.” If Shakespeare had wanted to debunk astrology he would have given Edmund a wholly different chart. In sifting all this, it might be useful to remember Juliet’s famous lines: “What’s in a name? that which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet.” Readers today tend to take that as common sense. But there, too, Shakespeare is playing another game. In the play, it turns out that there is a great deal in a name: in Verona, the names of “Montague” or “Capulet” could get you killed.
