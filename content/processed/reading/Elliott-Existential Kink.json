When we succeed in this, the ego loses layers of its absorption in the fiction of separation, and comes more and more to see itself as just a particular (rather funny) expression of a much larger divine whole, the Self. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07XMG4BWN&#x26;location=554\">554</a> ^ref-5315</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">To cast a spell is to communicate with your personal unconscious and the collective unconscious in a way that generates specific results through synchronicity.
