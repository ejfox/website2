Wakan Tanka smiles upon us, because now we are as one: earth, sky, all living things, the two-legged, the four-legged, the winged ones, the trees, the grasses. Together with the people, they are all related, one family. The pipe holds them all together. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B00GEYN1CK&#x26;location=1239\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1239</a> ^ref-8033</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">the one holy object in the making of which both men and women have a hand. The men carve the bowl and make the stem; the women decorate it with bands of colored porcupine quills. When a man takes a wife, they both hold the pipe at the same time and red trade cloth is wound around their hands, thus tying them together for life. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B00GEYN1CK&#x26;location=1254\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1254</a> ^ref-32391</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">He grew up into a fine young hunter, tall and good-looking in the quilled buckskin outfit the chief’s wife made for him.

They planted the sacred weed in a secret place that only they knew. They guarded the songs and prayers and rituals that went with smoking. They formed a Tobacco Society, just the four of them. So there was anger, there was war, there was restlessness of spirit, there was impiety. Nawak’osis was meant to calm anger, to make men worship, to make peace, to ease the mind. But without the sacred herb, unity and peace were lacking. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B00GEYN1CK&#x26;location=1482\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1482</a> ^ref-58809</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">“Well, you did find out one thing,” said the older of the two, who was his uncle. “You went after your vision like a hunter after buffalo, or a warrior after scalps. You were fighting the spirits. You thought they owed you a vision. Suffering alone brings no vision nor does courage, nor does sheer will power. A vision comes as a gift born of humility, of wisdom, and of patience. If from your vision quest you have learned nothing but this, then you have already learned much. Think about it.” — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B00GEYN1CK&#x26;location=1655\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1655</a> ^ref-59634</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>",
