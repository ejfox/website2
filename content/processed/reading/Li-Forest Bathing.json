They were only to be cut for the houses and temples of the powerful families. The rule of one head for one tree was brought in – which meant, as you have no doubt correctly guessed, that if you cut down a tree, your head would be cut off. ^ref-45535</p>\n</blockquote>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<blockquote class=\"pl-4 border-l-4 border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 my-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">Evergreens like pine trees, cedars, spruces and conifers are the largest producers of phytoncides. We will look more at what the forest smells like in the next chapter. For now, it will be enough to explain that the main components of phytoncides are terpenes, and these are what you can smell when you do shinrin-yoku in the forest. The major terpenes are: D-limonene – which smells, you guessed it, lemony Alpha-pinene – this is the most common terpene in nature and has a very fresh, piney scent Beta-pinene – smells more herby, like basil or dill Camphene – which has a turpentiney, resinous smell ^ref-34768</p>\n</blockquote>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<h2 class=\"\" id=\"metadata\">Metadata</h2>\n<ul class=\"list-disc\">\n<li class=\"\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.comundefined\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Dr Qing Li</a></li>\n<li class=\"\">ASIN: B077CQKQRR</li>\n<li class=\"\">ISBN: 052555985X</li>\n<li class=\"\">Reference: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077CQKQRR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077CQKQRR</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B077CQKQRR\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Kindle link</a></li>\n</ul>",
