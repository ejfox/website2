We can use this. We can use it as a compass. We can navigate by Resistance, letting it guide us to that calling or action that we must follow before all others. Rule of thumb: The more important a call or action is to our soul's evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing it. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B007A4SDCG&#x26;location=217\">217</a> ^ref-59828</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">Often couples or close friends, even entire families, will enter into tacit compacts whereby each individual pledges (unconsciously) to remain mired in the same slough in which she and all her cronies have become so comfortable. The highest treason a crab can commit is to make a leap for the rim of the bucket. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B007A4SDCG&#x26;location=267\">267</a> ^ref-29799</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">When we drug ourselves to blot out our soul's call, we are being good Americans and exemplary consumers. We're doing exactly what TV commercials and pop materialist culture have been brainwashing us to do from birth. Instead of applying self-knowledge, self-discipline, delayed gratification and hard work, we simply consume a product. Many pedestrians have been maimed or killed at the intersection of Resistance and Commerce. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B007A4SDCG&#x26;location=329\">329</a> ^ref-45319</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">The professional concentrates on the work and allows rewards to come or not come, whatever they like. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B007A4SDCG&#x26;location=480\">480</a> ^ref-25758</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">Now consider the amateur: the aspiring painter, the wannabe playwright. How does he pursue his calling? One, he doesn't show up every day. Two, he doesn't show up no matter what. Three, he doesn't stay on the job all day. He is not committed over the long haul; the stakes for him are illusory and fake. He does not get money. And he overidentifies with his art. He does not have a sense of humor about failure. You don't hear him bitching, \"This fucking trilogy is killing me!\" Instead, he doesn't write his trilogy at all. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B007A4SDCG&#x26;location=704\">704</a> ^ref-53525</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">The professional cannot live like that. He is on a mission. He will not tolerate disorder. He eliminates chaos from his world in order to banish it from his mind. He wants the carpet vacuumed and the threshold swept, so the Muse may enter and not soil her gown. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B007A4SDCG&#x26;location=771\">771</a> ^ref-54711</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">Why have I stressed professionalism so heavily in the preceding chapters? Because the most important thing about art is to work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying. Why is this so important? Because when we sit down day after day and keep grinding, something mysterious starts to happen. A process is set into motion by which, inevitably and infallibly, heaven comes to our aid. Unseen forces enlist in our cause; serendipity reinforces our purpose. This is the other secret that real artists know and wannabe writers don't. When we sit down each day and do our work, power concentrates around us. The Muse takes note of our dedication. She approves. We have earned favor in her sight. When we sit down and work, we become like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. Ideas come. Insights accrete. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B007A4SDCG&#x26;location=1007\">1007</a> ^ref-50092</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">Here's Socrates, in Plato's Phaedrus, on the \"noble effect of heaven-sent madness\": The third type of possession and madness is possession by the Muses. When this seizes upon a gentle and virgin soul it rouses it to inspired expression in lyric and other sorts of poetry, and glorifies countless deeds of the heroes of old for the instruction of posterity. But if a man comes to the door of poetry untouched by the madness of the Muses, believing that technique alone will make him a good poet, he and his sane compositions never reach perfection, but are utterly eclipsed by the performances of the inspired madman. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B007A4SDCG&#x26;location=1064\">1064</a> ^ref-56831</p>\n<hr>"
