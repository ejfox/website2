The metaphorical meaning of “leading” a battle in which verbal and later cybernetic commands or leadership replaces the physical presence of commanders on the field of battle tracks with the deskilling, depersonalization, and democratization of warfare into a quantitative enterprise.11 The faith in overwhelming force over strategic or limited ends explains a great deal about contemporary practices of combat wreaking havoc with little success around the globe. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=1926\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">1926</a> ^ref-17432</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>",

The leader often actually led, in the physical sense, the troops into battle. The leaders were the front line or tip of the cannae or wedge shape that fighters formed as they raced toward their enemy. The metaphorical meaning of “leading” a battle in which verbal and later cybernetic commands or leadership replaces the physical presence of commanders on the field of battle tracks with the deskilling, depersonalization, and democratization of warfare into a quantitative enterprise.11 The faith in overwhelming force over strategic or limited ends explains a great deal about contemporary practices of combat wreaking havoc with little success around the globe. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=1926\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">1926</a> ^ref-17432</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>",
