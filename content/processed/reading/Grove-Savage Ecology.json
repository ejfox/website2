Learn to die, learn to live, learn to listen, learn to be together, and learn to be generous. These virtues are useless in that they do not prevent or manage things. They do not translate into learning objectives or metrics. Virtues of this order are selfsame, nontransferable experiences. They are meaningful but not useful. These are luxurious virtues. Like grieving or joy, they are ends unto themselves. But how will these ideas seek extramural grants, contribute to an outcomes-based education system, or become a policy recommendation? They will not, and that is part of their virtue. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=776\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">776</a> ^ref-48663</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">From the atom bomb to the untold billions of martial artifacts, including shells, planes, and fallen soldiers, the last five hundred years will certainly be characterized by an accelerating rate of organized and disorganized murder and violence. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=1427\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1427</a> ^ref-8150</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">To put it a bit more bluntly, politics, colonialism, settlement, capitalism, ecological destruction, racism, and misogynies are not wars by other means—they are war. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=1457\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1457</a> ^ref-63147</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">While it is valuable to investigate how leaders can function to amplify conflict, what is striking is how quickly any one leader can be replaced and how little the trajectory of war changes. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=1573\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1573</a> ^ref-8215</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">One might take a lesson from the electrification of sound. In order to amplify or magnify a sound and preserve the fidelity of a particular harmonic arrangement, one cannot simply “turn up” the volume. It requires a certain interface between the means of amplification, the ambient qualities of the room, the number of people present, and the resonant capabilities of those people, the furniture, the walls, the floor, and the ceiling. Similarly, political decrees or decisions to produce effects must reverberate and interface with complex assemblages of institutions, economies, ethical dispositions, affective discourses, and other machinic operators. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=1591\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1591</a> ^ref-60986</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">From an ecological perspective, “wholes” and “singularities” are not ontologically real.

The leader often actually led, in the physical sense, the troops into battle. The leaders were the front line or tip of the cannae or wedge shape that fighters formed as they raced toward their enemy. The metaphorical meaning of “leading” a battle in which verbal and later cybernetic commands or leadership replaces the physical presence of commanders on the field of battle tracks with the deskilling, depersonalization, and democratization of warfare into a quantitative enterprise.11 The faith in overwhelming force over strategic or limited ends explains a great deal about contemporary practices of combat wreaking havoc with little success around the globe. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=1926\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1926</a> ^ref-17432</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>",

For me, this is the most inescapable philosophical provocation of our moment in time. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=718\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">718</a> ^ref-36082</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">No one is in control, there is no conspiracy, and yet the killing continues. A pessimistic reading of U.S. empire and the geopolitical history that precedes it is neither tragedy nor farce. It is a catastrophic banality lacking in any and all history, a pile of nonevents so suffocating that we often hope for a conspiracy, punctuating event, or villain worthy of the scale of violence. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=750\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">750</a> ^ref-34136</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">What would failed scholarship do? Learn to die, learn to live, learn to listen, learn to be together, and learn to be generous. These virtues are useless in that they do not prevent or manage things. They do not translate into learning objectives or metrics. Virtues of this order are selfsame, nontransferable experiences. They are meaningful but not useful. These are luxurious virtues. Like grieving or joy, they are ends unto themselves. But how will these ideas seek extramural grants, contribute to an outcomes-based education system, or become a policy recommendation? They will not, and that is part of their virtue. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=776\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">776</a> ^ref-48663</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">From the atom bomb to the untold billions of martial artifacts, including shells, planes, and fallen soldiers, the last five hundred years will certainly be characterized by an accelerating rate of organized and disorganized murder and violence. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=1427\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1427</a> ^ref-8150</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">To put it a bit more bluntly, politics, colonialism, settlement, capitalism, ecological destruction, racism, and misogynies are not wars by other means—they are war. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=1457\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1457</a> ^ref-63147</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">While it is valuable to investigate how leaders can function to amplify conflict, what is striking is how quickly any one leader can be replaced and how little the trajectory of war changes. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=1573\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1573</a> ^ref-8215</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">One might take a lesson from the electrification of sound. In order to amplify or magnify a sound and preserve the fidelity of a particular harmonic arrangement, one cannot simply “turn up” the volume. It requires a certain interface between the means of amplification, the ambient qualities of the room, the number of people present, and the resonant capabilities of those people, the furniture, the walls, the floor, and the ceiling. Similarly, political decrees or decisions to produce effects must reverberate and interface with complex assemblages of institutions, economies, ethical dispositions, affective discourses, and other machinic operators. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=1591\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1591</a> ^ref-60986</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">From an ecological perspective, “wholes” and “singularities” are not ontologically real.

The leader often actually led, in the physical sense, the troops into battle. The leaders were the front line or tip of the cannae or wedge shape that fighters formed as they raced toward their enemy. The metaphorical meaning of “leading” a battle in which verbal and later cybernetic commands or leadership replaces the physical presence of commanders on the field of battle tracks with the deskilling, depersonalization, and democratization of warfare into a quantitative enterprise.11 The faith in overwhelming force over strategic or limited ends explains a great deal about contemporary practices of combat wreaking havoc with little success around the globe. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B07V5V2P1V&#x26;location=1926\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1926</a> ^ref-17432</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>",
