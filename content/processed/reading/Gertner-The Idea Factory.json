Kelly defined it as the application of science to a problem affecting society. Engineers dipped into the “common reservoir” of science on behalf of their own industries and countries. ^ref-10216</p>\n</blockquote>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<blockquote class=\"pl-4 border-l-4 border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 my-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">By intention, everyone would be in one another’s way. Members of the technical staff would often have both laboratories and small offices—but these might be in different corridors, therefore making it necessary to walk between the two, and all but assuring a chance encounter or two with a colleague during the commute. ^ref-55615</p>\n</blockquote>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<blockquote class=\"pl-4 border-l-4 border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 my-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">They were not to work with their doors closed. They were not to refuse help to a colleague, regardless of his rank or department, when it might be necessary. And perhaps most important, the supervisor was authorized to guide, not interfere with, the people he (or she) managed. “The management style was, and remained for many years, to use the lightest touch and absolutely never to compete with underlings,” ^ref-21560</p>\n</blockquote>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<blockquote class=\"pl-4 border-l-4 border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 my-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">As Jack Morton had said, if you hadn’t sold anything you hadn’t innovated, and without an affordable price you could never sell anything. ^ref-62115</p>\n</blockquote>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<blockquote class=\"pl-4 border-l-4 border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 my-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">ALL WRITTEN AND SPOKEN EXCHANGES, to some degree, depend on code—the symbolic letters on the page, or the sounds of consonants and vowels that are transmitted (encoded) by our voices and received (decoded) by our ears and minds. With each passing decade, modern technology has tended to push everyday written and spoken exchanges ever deeper into the realm of ciphers, symbols, and electronically enhanced puzzles of representation. ^ref-36325</p>\n</blockquote>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<blockquote class=\"pl-4 border-l-4 border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 my-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">One of his paper’s underlying tenets, Shannon would later say, “is that information can be treated very much like a physical quantity, such as mass or energy.” ^ref-47480</p>\n</blockquote>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<blockquote class=\"pl-4 border-l-4 border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 my-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400\">The bit, Shannon explained, “corresponds to the information produced when a choice is made from two equally likely possibilities. If I toss a coin and tell you that it came down heads, I am giving you one bit of information about this event.” ^ref-9912</p>\n</blockquote>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<h2 class=\"\" id=\"metadata\">Metadata</h2>\n<ul class=\"list-disc\">\n<li class=\"\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.comundefined\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Jon Gertner</a></li>\n<li class=\"\">ASIN: B005GSZIWG</li>\n<li class=\"\">ISBN: B00I0GEN7W</li>\n<li class=\"\">Reference: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GSZIWG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GSZIWG</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B005GSZIWG\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Kindle link</a></li>\n</ul>",
