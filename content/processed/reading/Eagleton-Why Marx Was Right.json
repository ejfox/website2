That there is a life after Marxism is the whole point of Marxism. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004V9IFDA&#x26;location=76\">76</a> ^ref-27624</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">The stage was thus set for Reagan and Thatcher, who would help to dismantle traditional manufacture, shackle the labour movement, let the market rip, strengthen the repressive arm of the state and champion a new social philosophy known as barefaced greed. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004V9IFDA&#x26;location=111\">111</a> ^ref-61010</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">It was not this that led them to ditch Marxism along with their sideburns and headbands, but the growing conviction that the regime they confronted was simply too hard to crack. It was not illusions about the new capitalism, but disillusion about the possibility of changing it, which proved decisive. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004V9IFDA&#x26;location=115\">115</a> ^ref-30367</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">How do we fight this?

But it has done so, as did Stalin and Mao, at a staggering human cost.

Yet one needs at least to take account of the role of modern information technology in oiling the wheels of such a system. Even the former vice-president of Procter &#x26; Gamble has acknowledged that it makes workers’ self-management a real possibility. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004V9IFDA&#x26;location=333\">333</a> ^ref-59785</p>\n<hr>"
