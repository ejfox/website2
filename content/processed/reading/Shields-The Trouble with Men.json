I’ve always let it come to me, which of course is a rather passive approach to existence, but the funny thing is: inevitably, it comes. Sooner or later, whether I wanted it or not, the world came to me; it came at me, it keeps coming at me. — location: [604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MT424DM&location=604) ^ref-15080\n\n---\n\nGirls with asses like mine do not talk to boys with faces like yours. [Karen McCullah Lutz] — location: [976](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MT424DM&location=976) ^ref-33935\n\n---\n\n(I wasn’t in love with you when we got married, but I am now, whereas I suspect the opposite is true for you.) — location: [1079](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MT424DM&location=1079) ^ref-45275\n\n---\n\nOnce, I asked Jack if he loved me. “Of course I love you,” he said. “Then why don’t you ever tell me?” “It would be like having to tell you I’m breathing,” he said. “It would be like if, in a movie, the hero turned to the woman just before they ran into a barrage of gunfire, took her hand, and said, ‘Doris, I’m breathing.’ I’ve always been breathing. It would be like having her say, ‘I know. I’m breathing, too.’” [Linker] — location: [1142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MT424DM&location=1142) ^ref-21482\n\n---\n\nWhile women today think the ’90s was when the look became popular, the first Playboy centerfold featuring a shaved vagina didn’t take place until about 2002. — location: [1326](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MT424DM&location=1326) ^ref-35336\n\n---\n\nThere is one woman whom fate has destined for each of us; if we miss her, we are saved. — location: [1485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MT424DM&location=1485) ^ref-404\n\n---\n\nThe love that lasts the longest is the love that is never returned. — location: [1486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07MT424DM&location=1486) ^ref-11707\n\n---\n"
