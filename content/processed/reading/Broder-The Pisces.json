What if there was no wrong or right action in terms of who you loved, who you wanted, or who you were drawn to? If the will of the universe was the will of the universe, and if everything was happening as it was, then wasn’t everything you could possibly do all right? — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B074LVLHF2&#x26;location=1842\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">1842</a> ^ref-57612</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">“I don’t know if that’s love or something else,” I said. “But I don’t think it’s love if the person disappears.” “I wouldn’t say it’s not love,” he said. “But it’s hard.

Or perhaps I planted the words in him, as so much of what our lovers do and say is imagined. We turn them into who we want them to be.

Those women knew how to embrace whichever assembly-line man they were given. They knew how to breathe new life into him day after day and see what they had as special. They were like living psalms. There were no holes in their lives. Those women had never met a void a day in their life. They simply didn’t see any. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B074LVLHF2&#x26;location=3259\" class=\"prose-sm text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline transition-colors duration-200\">3259</a> ^ref-57368</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-sm max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">If I was dead and he wasn’t dead, did that mean he had all the power?
