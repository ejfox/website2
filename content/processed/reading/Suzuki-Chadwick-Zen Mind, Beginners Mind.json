You should do it completely, like a good bonfire. You should not be a smoky fire. You should burn yourself completely. If you do not burn yourself completely, a trace of yourself will be left in what you do. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=790\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">790</a> ^ref-7172</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If you practice zazen with your whole body and mind, even for a moment, that is zazen.

Everyone forgets about God. They work very hard at the second and third kinds of creation, but God does not help the activity. How is it possible for Him to help when He does not realize who He is? — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=850\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">850</a> ^ref-62163</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Of course, to live is to create problems. If we did not appear in this world, our parents would have no difficulty with us! Just by appearing we create problems for them. This is all right. Everything creates some problems. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=854\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">854</a> ^ref-63829</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">And we should do something new. To do something new, of course we must know our past, and this is all right. But we should not keep holding on to anything we have done; we should only reflect on it. And we must have some idea of what we should do in the future. But the future is the future, the past is the past; now we should work on something new. This is our attitude, and how we should live in this world. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=860\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">860</a> ^ref-21793</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Even in wrong practice, when you realize it and continue, there is right practice. Our practice cannot be perfect, but without being discouraged by this, we should continue it. This is the secret of practice. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=901\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">901</a> ^ref-17677</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The way to practice without having any goal is to limit your activity, or to be concentrated on what you are doing in this moment. Instead of having some particular object in mind, you should limit your activity. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=923\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">923</a> ^ref-23605</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">When you bow, you should just bow; when you sit, you should just sit; when you eat, you should just eat. If you do this, the universal nature is there. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=929\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">929</a> ^ref-3731</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">I think some of you who practice zazen here may believe in some other religion, but I do not mind. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=932\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">932</a> ^ref-2392</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The purpose of studying Buddhism is not to study Buddhism, but to study ourselves. It is impossible to study ourselves without some teaching. If you want to know what water is you need science, and the scientist needs a laboratory. In the laboratory there are various ways in which to study what water is. Thus it is possible to know what kind of elements water has, the various forms it takes, and its nature. But it is impossible thereby to know water in — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=942\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">942</a> ^ref-28465</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">itself.

To be aware of the meaning of your life, you practice zazen. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=961\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">961</a> ^ref-51296</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>",

This is an example of leaving a trace of one’s thinking. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=787\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">787</a> ^ref-16169</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">It is necessary to remember what we have done, but we should not become attached to what we have done in some special sense. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=789\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">789</a> ^ref-25839</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In order not to leave any traces, when you do something, you should do it with your whole body and mind; you should be concentrated on what you do. You should do it completely, like a good bonfire. You should not be a smoky fire. You should burn yourself completely. If you do not burn yourself completely, a trace of yourself will be left in what you do. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=790\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">790</a> ^ref-7172</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If you practice zazen with your whole body and mind, even for a moment, that is zazen. So moment after moment you should devote yourself to your practice. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=797\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">797</a> ^ref-43190</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Usually everyone forgets about zazen. Everyone forgets about God. They work very hard at the second and third kinds of creation, but God does not help the activity. How is it possible for Him to help when He does not realize who He is? — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=850\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">850</a> ^ref-62163</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Of course, to live is to create problems. If we did not appear in this world, our parents would have no difficulty with us! Just by appearing we create problems for them. This is all right. Everything creates some problems. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=854\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">854</a> ^ref-63829</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">And we should do something new. To do something new, of course we must know our past, and this is all right. But we should not keep holding on to anything we have done; we should only reflect on it. And we must have some idea of what we should do in the future. But the future is the future, the past is the past; now we should work on something new. This is our attitude, and how we should live in this world. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=860\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">860</a> ^ref-21793</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Even in wrong practice, when you realize it and continue, there is right practice. Our practice cannot be perfect, but without being discouraged by this, we should continue it. This is the secret of practice. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=901\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">901</a> ^ref-17677</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The way to practice without having any goal is to limit your activity, or to be concentrated on what you are doing in this moment. Instead of having some particular object in mind, you should limit your activity. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=923\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">923</a> ^ref-23605</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">When you bow, you should just bow; when you sit, you should just sit; when you eat, you should just eat. If you do this, the universal nature is there. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=929\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">929</a> ^ref-3731</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">I think some of you who practice zazen here may believe in some other religion, but I do not mind. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=932\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">932</a> ^ref-2392</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The purpose of studying Buddhism is not to study Buddhism, but to study ourselves. It is impossible to study ourselves without some teaching. If you want to know what water is you need science, and the scientist needs a laboratory. In the laboratory there are various ways in which to study what water is. Thus it is possible to know what kind of elements water has, the various forms it takes, and its nature. But it is impossible thereby to know water in — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=942\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">942</a> ^ref-28465</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">itself. It is the same thing with us. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=945\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">945</a> ^ref-5934</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">So to find the meaning of your life in the zendo is to find the meaning of your everyday activity. To be aware of the meaning of your life, you practice zazen. — location: <a href=\"kindle://book?action=open&#x26;asin=B004R9QFGS&#x26;location=961\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">961</a> ^ref-51296</p>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>",
