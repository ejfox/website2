I’ve spent the past year orchestrating a series of systems to store my photographs, screenshots, and media through Cloudinary. But what I hadn’t done, I suddenly realized, was build a way to back up my photos from Cloudinary onto an external hard drive.

A year of digital memories, screenshots of brilliant tweets, photos of questionable life choices—all sitting in someone else’s data center, about to vanish like the brilliant insights of last night’s trip.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">So it was time to whip up a little app. Fast.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6\" id=\"the-stack\">The Stack</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">No time for my usual Vue/Nuxt comfort zone.

Clean endpoints, sensible rate limits, pagination that actually works. In a world of hostile APIs and developer contempt, they built something that works.
