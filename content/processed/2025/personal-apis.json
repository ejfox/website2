For example I have a bot that txts me the weather every day. That's fine and easy, but I also feed it my health data so it can do things like \"its gonna be a nice day today and you are due for a walk!\" because my health data is there. It was a small tweak that made the touchpoint spark joy instead of feel like another rote notification.</p>\n<p class=\"\">The APIs I have been building are based on my personal KPIs– for lack of a better term. Forgive my broken brain. As they say, you can't improve what you don't measure. So the stats I collect and resurface are based on how I want to live my life.</p>\n<p class=\"\">I want to write more blog posts; so I measure cumulative total words written. I wanna get better at chess; so I measure my Chess.com score. I wanna be a better programmer and learn data science and algorithms; so I have my leetcode history. Often the bottleneck when interacting with computers is just how quickly I can get my ideas out; so I track typing speed.</p>\n<p class=\"\">My choices for what data to gobble up are based on my natural intuition and the things I want to improve on. The implementation is straightforward - I just use basic caching in the Nuxt / Nitro API. Its not that hard and the results feel powerful.</p>\n<p class=\"\">It's also kinda based on what's simply <strong class=\"\">available</strong> and what services offer data egress. Though I do always choose services that offer APIs and the ability to export my data wherever possible (fuck Facebook for slowly enshittifying all their APIs over the past 10 years).</p>\n<p class=\"\">This project was deeply inspired by quantified self and the Feltron annual report and tim ferris and that sort of self-tracking and improvement movement, oh and Gwern! From them, I learned a few specific lessons:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc\">\n<li class=\"\">Feltron taught me to focus on simple narrative metrics, where less is more</li>\n<li class=\"\">Ferriss taught me anything is learnable with a system and persistence</li>\n<li class=\"\">Gwern taught me that all experimentation is valuable with enough documentation, and that if you are ahead of the curve and just document your own interests than some time later as people catch up they will find your work</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"\">We live in a post capitalist digital surveillance state, so theoretically the algorithm(s) already have a dashboard of intelligence on me.
