That means that each tool and its description are taking up some of your context window, whether they are relevant or not. Which means you need to think through your toolkit carefully.</p>\n<p class=\"\">My first instinct, shared by many, is to load the robot up with <em class=\"\">as many tools as possible</em>. You can stay up late configuring your API keys and imagining the possibilities. I went through this with Obsidian Plugins. But over time, I came to realize the extra plugins didn’t help as much as I thought. Worse, they slowed down every interaction (particularly on mobile.) I anticipate a similar arc with MCP servers.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Given a completely novel territory I did what any hacker-come-cartographer might do, I tried to make a map of it, aided at every step by the robot of course. (This is <a href=\"../robots/quantified-self-as-archaeology%7Carchaeology,-not-optimizatio\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">../robots/quantified-self-as-archaeology|archaeology, not optimizatio</a>n]] - exploring data to reveal patterns, not to find the \"best\" MCP.)</p>\n<p class=\"\">The first step was to take the MCP names and descriptions and turn them into embeddings; getting their location in hyper-dimensional space that we can use to arrange, cluster, and categorize them roughly by what they do (if we configure our parameters correctly)</p>\n<p class=\"\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_800/v1742924387/Screen_Recording_2025-03-25_at_1.38.45_PM.gif\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_400/v1742924387/Screen_Recording_2025-03-25_at_1.38.45_PM.gif 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_800/v1742924387/Screen_Recording_2025-03-25_at_1.38.45_PM.gif 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/video/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1742924387/Screen_Recording_2025-03-25_at_1.38.45_PM.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 768px) 80vw, 100vw\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-full my-8 rounded-sm w-full mx-auto py-4\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></p>\n<p class=\"\">Now that we have a file full of the titles, descriptions, and embeddings we can apply “dimension reduction” to take the point from 4096TK dimensions, which I struggle to imagine, to 2 dimensions, which I can imagine quite easily.</p>\n<p class=\"\">A ton of points with X and Y positions? That’s data begging to be a scatterplot if I ever saw it. We can run our dimension reduction algorithms with all sorts of different parameters and see what the resulting piles look like. Some seem to have more prominent groupings, some look like true jumbles.</p>\n<p class=\"\">We are naively, intuitively “tuning” our parameters across hyper-dimensional space, like tuning your radio and looking for strong signals that might turn from noise into Fresh Air or the local Classic Rock station.</p>\n<p class=\"\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_800/v1742920334/parameter_grid_ekueka.png\" alt=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1742920334/parameter_grid_ekueka.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_400/v1742920334/parameter_grid_ekueka.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_800/v1742920334/parameter_grid_ekueka.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1742920334/parameter_grid_ekueka.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 768px) 80vw, 100vw\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-full my-8 rounded-sm w-full mx-auto py-4\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></p>\n<p class=\"\">Once we have arranged our points, whose positions contain some meaning (one that is impossible for us to label simply on X and Y axes, at this point) that we need to discover.</p>\n<p class=\"\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_800/v1742920403/umap_grid_16x16_silhouette_fpmntg.png\" alt=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1742920403/umap_grid_16x16_silhouette_fpmntg.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_400/v1742920403/umap_grid_16x16_silhouette_fpmntg.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_800/v1742920403/umap_grid_16x16_silhouette_fpmntg.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1742920403/umap_grid_16x16_silhouette_fpmntg.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 768px) 80vw, 100vw\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-full my-8 rounded-sm w-full mx-auto py-4\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></p>\n<p class=\"\">From here we can run a number of clustering algorithms, created by people much smarter than ourselves, each with their own arcane parameters to be tuned and explored.

Maps like these can help us perform these exercises. I am a visual thinker, so for me, it is interesting to draw lines between clusters and think what it might look like to combine them in new ways or find gaps in coverage. This is strategy, not tactics.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Embeddings are just one particular method of exploring this dataset. We could probably ask the robot to apply some tags based on the data and use that to create groupings and taxonomies. But what list of tags to give it to choose from? Its a bit of a chicken and egg problem.</p>",
