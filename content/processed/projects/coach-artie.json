But traditional tools fragment workflows.

Exploring AI consciousness emergence through memory pattern analysis—applying scientific rigor to questions about what happens when AI systems develop persistent context.</p>\n<h2 class=\"\" id=\"why-this-matters\">Why This Matters</h2>\n<p class=\"\">This is how I work now. AI assistants aren't just tools—they're collaborators. Coach Artie is both a product and a research platform for understanding human-AI creative workflows.</p>",
