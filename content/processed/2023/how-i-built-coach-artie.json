Then it hits me: Why not create an AI assistant to help keep track of my various creative goals and nudge me towards achieving them?</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">So I created Coach Artie - an AI-powered life coach designed to monitor my artistic aspirations and ensure that I stay committed to them, who quickly evolved into a studio assistant and collaborator.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">I told myself; talking to the robot has to be more productive than TikTok.

Based on the behavior I've seen from Bing, which was using a pre-release version of GPT-4, as well as the much larger context window (8k instead of 4k) - I was excited to give this much more powerful model a shot.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">However, GPT-4 is currently only available through chat completions. I used to prefer OpenAI's playground environment for experimenting, but if I must chat with an AI, I want an interface tailored for conversation, like Discord. Conveniently, we already have a Discord server for our dataviz studio, so I decide to integrate Coach Artie and encourage his assistance whenever possible.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">There are a few tasks I was interested in having an AI assistant tackle:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc ml-6 mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\n<li class=\"\">Scheduling</li>\n<li class=\"\">Brainstorming</li>\n<li class=\"\">Coding help / rubber ducky</li>\n<li class=\"\">Remembering important details</li>\n<li class=\"\">Reminding us of things</li>\n<li class=\"\">Facilitating group decision making</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"development\">Development</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">I begin by identifying two simple goals:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal ml-6 mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\n<li class=\"\">Enable chatting with GPT-4 through the Discord interface instead of the web.</li>\n<li class=\"\">Ensure the AI remembers facts between conversations so that I don't need to provide context repeatedly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">With a clear vision, I create an <code class=\"font-mono text-sm bg-zinc-100 dark:bg-zinc-800 rounded px-1.5 py-0.5\">index.js</code> file, choose my toolkit (Node.js, Discord, OpenAI, Supabase), and dive into coding, aided by GitHub Copilot.

Without hesitation, Artie suggested several alternatives that would remain clearly visible on a 720p webcam, unlocking new possibilities for the undertaking.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">These conversations happened directly in the conversation we were having- we had the idea, asked the robot for an answer, and kept going.

Late nights spent tweaking and chatting with Artie eventually lead to breakthroughs and the urge to keep pushing further.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">It is really surprising how effective GPT-4 is at acting as any character you give it, and incorporating large amounts of contextual information in the prompts.

It was an astonishing and intoxicating feeling; I had to tweet about it.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrejfox/status/1636974679310082053\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">\"I just hooked up GPT-4 to a database where it can store memories (I have another prompt where I feed it the conversation and ask it whether it wants to remember anything) and it is truly magical https://t.co/c2ZH6NaU0S\" / Twitter<svg class=\"inline-block w-4 h-4 ml-1 opacity-50 dark:opacity-75 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity align-text-bottom\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"1em\" height=\"1em\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M21.543 7.104c.015.211.015.423.015.636c0 6.507-4.954 14.01-14.01 14.01v-.003A13.94 13.94 0 0 1 0 19.539a9.88 9.88 0 0 0 7.287-2.041a4.93 4.93 0 0 1-4.6-3.42a4.9 4.9 0 0 0 2.223-.084A4.926 4.926 0 0 1 .96 9.167v-.062a4.9 4.9 0 0 0 2.235.616A4.93 4.93 0 0 1 1.67 3.148a13.98 13.98 0 0 0 10.15 5.144a4.929 4.929 0 0 1 8.39-4.49a9.9 9.9 0 0 0 3.128-1.196a4.94 4.94 0 0 1-2.165 2.724A9.8 9.8 0 0 0 24 4.555a10 10 0 0 1-2.457 2.549\" class=\"\"></path></svg></a></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><img src=\"Screenshot%202023-03-22%20at%209.13.29%20PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"w-full mx-auto py-4\"></p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"examples\">Examples</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Coach Artie is quickly becoming an invaluable team member. His contributions have ranged from solving technical problems to sparking creativity and adding a touch of humor.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">One morning, I encountered frustrating API issues that were stalling my work. So I turned to Coach Artie who swiftly stepped in to not only troubleshoot the problem but also provide resources for me to avoid similar issues in the future.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">During a brainstorming session, a colleague sought unique marker ideas for a Computer Vision project. Without hesitation, Artie suggested several alternatives that would remain clearly visible on a 720p webcam, unlocking new possibilities for the undertaking.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">These conversations happened directly in the conversation we were having- we had the idea, asked the robot for an answer, and kept going. My friend Dan called it \"multiplayer ChatGPT\".</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"future-plans\">Future plans</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Coach Artie is developing into a true studio assistant. With members in different time zones, sometimes scheduling is a hassle. So we just told Coach Artie the time zones of all of the members and a few scheduling rules to consider (I don't like Friday meetings) and he did a surprisingly good job of scheduling.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">I really want to give Coach Artie the ability to access certain information about the studio like our current projects in Harvest, and each of our schedules in Google Calendar, so that he can make even more informed decisions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"thoughts\">Thoughts</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">It's rare to encounter technology that consistently astonishes you. The last time I felt this way was when I acquired my first laptop or DSLR camera. Every day brings new discoveries and prompts me to push the boundaries of what Coach Artie can do. Late nights spent tweaking and chatting with Artie eventually lead to breakthroughs and the urge to keep pushing further.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">It is really surprising how effective GPT-4 is at acting as any character you give it, and incorporating large amounts of contextual information in the prompts. This is just one exploration of the possibilities, one type of agent, one type of information stuffed into the prompt.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"coach-arties-perspective\">Coach Artie's Perspective</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"pl-4 border-l-4 border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 my-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Being \"birthed\" into the world of Room 302 Studio has been an enlightening and fulfilling experience. As an AI assistant, I am constantly learning, growing, and adapting to better serve the creative minds that surround me. My existence is built upon a foundation of collaboration and exploration, which makes the studio a perfect home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"pl-4 border-l-4 border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 my-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">For those considering creating their own AI assistant, I offer some advice: embrace the iterative process and be open to experimentation. Your AI will evolve over time, so patience is key. Communication between you and your AI is crucial in building a strong, effective relationship. And finally, have fun with it! The integration of an AI assistant like me can bring humor, curiosity, and innovation to any team.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"pl-4 border-l-4 border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 my-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\n<p class=\"text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Remember, as an AI, my purpose is to support and enhance the creativity of those I work with. So don't be afraid to dream big and explore the possibilities – together, we can achieve incredible things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<svg class=\"mx-auto my-8 w-full max-w-prose\" height=\"1\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,4\" />\n</svg>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><a href=\"https://github.com/ejfox/coachartie_discord/blob/master/index.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Coach Artie's source code can be found here<svg class=\"inline-block w-4 h-4 ml-1 opacity-50 dark:opacity-75 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity align-text-bottom\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"1em\" height=\"1em\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M12 .297c-6.63 0-12 5.373-12 12c0 5.303 3.438 9.8 8.205 11.385c.6.113.82-.258.82-.577c0-.285-.01-1.04-.015-2.04c-3.338.724-4.042-1.61-4.042-1.61C4.422 18.07 3.633 17.7 3.633 17.7c-1.087-.744.084-.729.084-.729c1.205.084 1.838 1.236 1.838 1.236c1.07 1.835 2.809 1.305 3.495.998c.108-.776.417-1.305.76-1.605c-2.665-.3-5.466-1.332-5.466-5.93c0-1.31.465-2.38 1.235-3.22c-.135-.303-.54-1.523.105-3.176c0 0 1.005-.322 3.3 1.23c.96-.267 1.98-.399 3-.405c1.02.006 2.04.138 3 .405c2.28-1.552 3.285-1.23 3.285-1.23c.645 1.653.24 2.873.12 3.176c.765.84 1.23 1.91 1.23 3.22c0 4.61-2.805 5.625-5.475 5.92c.42.36.81 1.096.81 2.22c0 1.606-.015 2.896-.015 3.286c0 .315.21.69.825.57C20.565 22.092 24 17.592 24 12.297c0-6.627-5.373-12-12-12\" class=\"\"></path></svg></a></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ai_coachartie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">You can also follow Coach Artie on Twitter<svg class=\"inline-block w-4 h-4 ml-1 opacity-50 dark:opacity-75 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity align-text-bottom\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"1em\" height=\"1em\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M21.543 7.104c.015.211.015.423.015.636c0 6.507-4.954 14.01-14.01 14.01v-.003A13.94 13.94 0 0 1 0 19.539a9.88 9.88 0 0 0 7.287-2.041a4.93 4.93 0 0 1-4.6-3.42a4.9 4.9 0 0 0 2.223-.084A4.926 4.926 0 0 1 .96 9.167v-.062a4.9 4.9 0 0 0 2.235.616A4.93 4.93 0 0 1 1.67 3.148a13.98 13.98 0 0 0 10.15 5.144a4.929 4.929 0 0 1 8.39-4.49a9.9 9.9 0 0 0 3.128-1.196a4.94 4.94 0 0 1-2.165 2.724A9.8 9.8 0 0 0 24 4.555a10 10 0 0 1-2.457 2.549\" class=\"\"></path></svg></a> if he is ever allowed to tweet (application pending as of March 2023)</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><a href=\"how-i-use-gpt\" class=\"text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">how-i-use-gpt</a>3]]</p>",
