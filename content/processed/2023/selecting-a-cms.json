It must be intuitive for content creators and allow developers the flexibility to easily extend and customize functionality without unintentionally causing issues.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"help-your-process\">Help your process</h4>\n<p class=\"\">A good CMS can help with the process of revisions, edits, and versioning. It might be a place where discussion or feedback takes place. It should reinforce your existing processes; not force you to adopt new ones.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"be-secure\">Be secure</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Your CMS should be secure. This means that it should be regularly updated to fix security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p class=\"\">It should have authentication features like password protection and user permissions to control who can access the CMS and what they can do. Publishing and editing live articles should be available to a limited number of users.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"be-scalable\">Be scalable</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Your CMS should be scalable. This means that it should be able to handle large spikes in traffic.</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"how-do-you-handle-versioning\">How do you handle versioning?</h3>\n<p class=\"\">Text should be versioned in easy to see snapshots in time with simple functionality to revert place in time. It should be easy to see all the changes made and who made them.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Graphics and interactive data visualizations should be stored in GitHub and each published version should be a new release and version number bump with a CHANGELOG of the differences between versions.</p>\n<p class=\"\">It should be easy to see any version of any asset and compare them.</p>\n<p class=\"\">CMSes could also do more to help with project management by showing versions to users as well as item status, deadline, and assignment information. Often this information is captured in software outside the CMS, but it would be great to have it all in one place.</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"where-do-you-keep-your-media\">Where do you keep your media?</h3>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"cloudinary\">Cloudinary</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Cloudinary is a cloud-based service that allows you to store, manage, and deliver your media assets. It provides a lot of features around image transformations and optimizations that make it a powerful option for displaying images and video.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"amazon-s3\">Amazon S3</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Amazon S3 is a cloud-based storage service that allows you to store and deliver your media assets. A lot of organizations already use S3, and it can be way easier to start putting assets in a new bucket in an S3 account that exists already.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"supabase-storage\">Supabase Storage</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Supabase Storage, an extension to the popular Supabase platform, which gives users an effortless way to handle large media files directly within their CMS interface. It integrates smoothly with other parts of Supabase, so if you are already storing your data in Supabase, it's an easy choice.</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"where-do-you-host-it\">Where do you host it?</h3>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"netlify\">Netlify</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Netlify is a cloud-based hosting service that allows you to deploy and host your website.</p>\n<p class=\"\">It has a free plan that allows you to deploy up to 3 sites and gives you 100GB of data transfer per month. It also has a paid plan that allows you to deploy an unlimited number of sites and gives you unlimited data transfer.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"amazon-aws\">Amazon AWS</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Amazon AWS is a cloud-based hosting service that allows you to deploy and host your website. It is much more difficult to automate deploys to AWS than to Netlify, in my experience. It is probably the most-used hosting service, but it is also the most expensive.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"self-hosting\">Self-hosting</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Self-hosting your website is an option if you have the technical expertise and resources to maintain and secure your server. It can give you complete control over your website, but it also requires a lot of work and can be costly in terms of time and money. It is not recommended for most individuals or small businesses without dedicated technical support.</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"cms-recommendations\">CMS Recommendations</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc\">\n<li class=\"\">Wordpress: sometimes the best CMS is the one your client is already using, and often, that is Wordpress.</li>\n<li class=\"\">Storyblok: A really next-level CMS built to be used headlessly in webapps, great extensibility, API, and documentation</li>\n</ul>",

It must be intuitive for content creators and allow developers the flexibility to easily extend and customize functionality without unintentionally causing issues.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"help-your-process\">Help your process</h4>\n<p class=\"\">A good CMS can help with the process of revisions, edits, and versioning. It might be a place where discussion or feedback takes place. It should reinforce your existing processes; not force you to adopt new ones.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"be-secure\">Be secure</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Your CMS should be secure. This means that it should be regularly updated to fix security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p class=\"\">It should have authentication features like password protection and user permissions to control who can access the CMS and what they can do. Publishing and editing live articles should be available to a limited number of users.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"be-scalable\">Be scalable</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Your CMS should be scalable. This means that it should be able to handle large spikes in traffic.</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"how-do-you-handle-versioning\">How do you handle versioning?</h3>\n<p class=\"\">Text should be versioned in easy to see snapshots in time with simple functionality to revert place in time. It should be easy to see all the changes made and who made them.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Graphics and interactive data visualizations should be stored in GitHub and each published version should be a new release and version number bump with a CHANGELOG of the differences between versions.</p>\n<p class=\"\">It should be easy to see any version of any asset and compare them.</p>\n<p class=\"\">CMSes could also do more to help with project management by showing versions to users as well as item status, deadline, and assignment information. Often this information is captured in software outside the CMS, but it would be great to have it all in one place.</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"where-do-you-keep-your-media\">Where do you keep your media?</h3>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"cloudinary\">Cloudinary</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Cloudinary is a cloud-based service that allows you to store, manage, and deliver your media assets. It provides a lot of features around image transformations and optimizations that make it a powerful option for displaying images and video.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"amazon-s3\">Amazon S3</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Amazon S3 is a cloud-based storage service that allows you to store and deliver your media assets. A lot of organizations already use S3, and it can be way easier to start putting assets in a new bucket in an S3 account that exists already.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"supabase-storage\">Supabase Storage</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Supabase Storage, an extension to the popular Supabase platform, which gives users an effortless way to handle large media files directly within their CMS interface. It integrates smoothly with other parts of Supabase, so if you are already storing your data in Supabase, it's an easy choice.</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"where-do-you-host-it\">Where do you host it?</h3>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"netlify\">Netlify</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Netlify is a cloud-based hosting service that allows you to deploy and host your website.</p>\n<p class=\"\">It has a free plan that allows you to deploy up to 3 sites and gives you 100GB of data transfer per month. It also has a paid plan that allows you to deploy an unlimited number of sites and gives you unlimited data transfer.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"amazon-aws\">Amazon AWS</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Amazon AWS is a cloud-based hosting service that allows you to deploy and host your website. It is much more difficult to automate deploys to AWS than to Netlify, in my experience. It is probably the most-used hosting service, but it is also the most expensive.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"self-hosting\">Self-hosting</h4>\n<p class=\"\">Self-hosting your website is an option if you have the technical expertise and resources to maintain and secure your server. It can give you complete control over your website, but it also requires a lot of work and can be costly in terms of time and money. It is not recommended for most individuals or small businesses without dedicated technical support.</p>\n<h3 class=\"\" id=\"cms-recommendations\">CMS Recommendations</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc\">\n<li class=\"\">Wordpress: sometimes the best CMS is the one your client is already using, and often, that is Wordpress.</li>\n<li class=\"\">Storyblok: A really next-level CMS built to be used headlessly in webapps, great extensibility, API, and documentation</li>\n</ul>",
