Finding a particular thing to focus on each day. Working with other people towards a common goal and accomplishing it.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">I have had a recurring thought about work which is it's not what you're doing in the proverbial mine, but who you're in the mine with.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">You could be doing any sort of work with the right people and attitude and it can be enjoyable.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><strong class=\"\">It is only possible to truly relax at the end of the day if you have done some good work.</strong> Otherwise what are you relaxing from?</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">It is important to have the balance, time on and time off. When the two blend and intermingle too far it becomes hard to keep track of when you are moving forward. (I say this having spent a lot of time freelancing and not setting boundaries well)</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">It is important to keep moving things forward. The forces of the universe keep the world spinning and fire ants keep collecting dirt for their ant hill and weeds keep breaking concrete in search of the sun and it is part of my job as a living being to play my part in that somehow.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Work helps me find the frequency at which I can harmonize with the cacophony.</p>\n<h2 class=\"text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"whats-work-for\">What’s work for?</h2>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Work is for focus. Finding a task that the world values so much they will give you money for it.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">To really understand what they value in you and to give it to them.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">To take that time to refine and perfect what you do so that your value increases.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">To bring people together to make things bigger than themselves. Bound by some sense of unity or shared goal or at least a desire to get paid. But people can do amazing things in the right combinations, amplifying each other's skills. Those combinations don't always occur naturally.

Chopping wood, pulling weeds, cooking food.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">I think a lot about traveling and offering to make little 30 second commercials for YouTube for small businesses in exchange for dinner or an oil change.

Enough money to not have to think about money. To not have money as either an obstacle or an object of desire. To move through the world with other goals and thoughts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"why-are-we-here\">Why are we here?</h2>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">I think we are one united disparate organism.

To build shared places to relax and play and create. To help those who have not been given as much.
