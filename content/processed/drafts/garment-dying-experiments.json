This is a unique dyeing process where you use ice cubes to create beautiful, intricate patterns on the fabric. As the ice slowly melts, it spreads the dye in interesting patterns and concentrations that are impossible to predict. It creates an interesting visual texture and depth of color, and I love the unexpected nature of the process.</p>\n<h3 class=\"prose-lg text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose md:pr-12 animate-on-scroll slide-from-left\" id=\"gradientdip-dyeing\">Gradient/Dip Dyeing</h3>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Dip dyeing is another technique I've been experimenting with. This method involves submerging the entire garment, or parts of the garment, in a dye bath and then gradually pulling the fabric out of the oxidizing dye to create a gradient effect. It's a great way to add a unique look to any garment.</p>\n<h2 class=\"prose-lg text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 max-w-prose border-b border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 pb-2 md:pr-12 animate-on-scroll slide-from-left\" id=\"process\">Process</h2>",
