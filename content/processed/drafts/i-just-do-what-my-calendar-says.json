It's an essential part of my process that I don't think about a lot, but I use Google Calendar to keep track of all my appointments, tasks, and deadlines.\n\nI'm also a big believer in setting deadlines and sticking to them. I try to set realistic deadlines for myself based on the amount of time I have available and the complexity of the task. This helps me stay focused and on track.\n\n![](IMG_8205.jpeg)\n\n### My Process\n\nWhen I have a task that needs to be done, I immediately make time for it on my calendar. This acts as a set a deadline for myself to make sure that I stick to it. This can include anything from appointments to deadlines for work projects.\n\n#### Next event is always visible\n\nI use Google Calendar to keep track of all of this, plus Fantastical on my MacBook for a quick view of my day. On my Apple Watch, I have a display of my next meeting, and on every computer I use, I have a menu bar that displays my upcoming meetings.\n\n#### Calendly & Reclaim\n\nI also use Calendly and Reclaim AI to help me schedule meetings and automate time between meetings, making sure I have enough time to adjust and refresh myself between calls.\n\nI also use my calendar to track my progress. I like to look back on my calendar and see how far I've come and how much I've accomplished. This helps me stay motivated and reminds me of why I'm working so hard.\n\nBy combining different technologies and processes, I'm able to optimize my schedule and stay productive. It's a relief to know that I'm able to stay on top of my tasks without being overwhelmed by all the details.\n\nBy having a consistent, well-oiled process, I can keep up with my schedule without losing my mind. With technology and a little bit of organization, I'm able to stay productive and organized.\n"
