I am sending it to about 20 people I trust.

But I think that the future lies in mutual aid; from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">I want to do a better job of using my ability to write code and manipulate computers to help my friends and community. I want to find more ways to barter, to grow our own food, and to build systems of resilience with much deeper roots than currently exist, across our country and our computer networks.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Being social and building community does not come naturally to me. I’d much prefer to spend days hyper-focused on a coding problem or untangling a complicated system. But nothing exists yet that fits my vision of what I would like to join, so I must do the potentially embarrassing and reckless task of putting myself out there.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">As our social media networks are run by increasingly shameless techno-fascists, I think that re-centering communications through email and Signal and off the social networks is going to be incredibly important. This is a first step towards that. I’m hoping to be sending more updates and potential touchpoint in the coming weeks as I hear back from people. But for now, if you’re receiving this email, I have a few questions for you to ponder. No pressure.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Is there anything you’re working on that you could use help with? Or want to show to other people? Is there anyone you think could use help in some way? Do you have ideas to build systems of resilience this spring and summer, and how can I help?</p>",
