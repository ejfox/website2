But its a bit too big to have your users download the entire thing, but too small to dedicate hosting a database for it forever. What are your options?\n\n## Host and client-side query Parquet\n\n## Intelligently chunk into static data assets\n\n## Use sqlite and datasette for an API\n\n## Put your large data on S3 or Cloudflare\n\n## Put your data into a Supabase project\n"
