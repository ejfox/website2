I guess the point is that I am feeling kind of grumpy today. Grumpy and unmotivated. I could tell you all the things I have been doing despite that, but again, who cares.

But it’s a waste of breath and typing-energy to even consider it, I suppose. What do people even write about? What inspires people to care about a thing, or obsess about it, or like, feel confident enough to feel that other people might want to enjoy their thoughts? It feels particularly alien to me to express uncertainty in writing because, again, who gives a shit. I guess it is cathartic in its own way.

That’s good. I suppose. That’s one thing worth worshipping. I do like it when numbers go up. But it also sort of cheapens the words– given this hidden compulsion, wouldn’t I go out of my way to find the most indirect route to convey an idea? But old writers used to be paid by the word so maybe that’s how we came to get the most irksome (and lauded) purple prose the english language has seen yet.</p>",
