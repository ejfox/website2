But I think when making things on the internet, there are a few key principles that I believe in.</p>\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ejf/image/upload/v1707582204/Screenshot_2024-02-10_at_11.23.09_AM.png\" alt=\"Generative art\">\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">This simple principle is applied in nearly every possible place. Everything I say is truthful, to the best of my ability. I research, follow standard journalism ethics and standards, and only say things that I know to be true.</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">I think this also applies to the way that things are shot and created; I want to be as honest to the moment as possible, and sometimes this might mean emphasizing authenticity at the expense of quality.</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">I prefer natural light to fancy complicated lighting setups. I prefer recording everything as early as possible, rather than going back and \"recreating\" key moments. I prefer letting people be their authentic selves, with minimal direction as to what they should say or do.</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">This also means, when I get things wrong, <em>issuing corrections</em> and clarifying why the mistake happened, and what was learned.</p>"
