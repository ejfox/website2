Staying on top of a hectic schedule can definitely feel overwhelming at times, but I've found that planning and scheduling my weeks carefully is the best way to stay productive and make sure nothing gets left out. Here's how I do it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6\" id=\"week-time-planning\">Week time planning</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">I'm a big fan of the <a href=\"https://calendly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">Calendly</a> app (which works both online and through its iOS app).
