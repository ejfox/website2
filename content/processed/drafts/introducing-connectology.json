It felt like there was space for a performant and visualization-minded approach to a frontend, so I set to work.</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">I finally have a version with all the basic functionality I have been wanting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Super easy to add nodes and links</li>\n<li>Full control over force layout settings</li>\n<li>Public shareable URLs of networks</li>\n<li>AI enhancement features to generate more connections, add nodes, and label networks in one-click</li>\n<li>Basic import functionality; import from CSV, or use an LLM to convert text into a network graph automatically</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">I have been using this tool myself to explore different topic areas, and I am excited to continue building it as a tool that directly helps me and my friends (you guys!) make more, better work, and uncover and illustrate the hidden connections the world is filled with.</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">I would love your thoughts/feedback on the tool, and please let me know if you encounter any bugs or rough corners. Appreciate it!</p>"
