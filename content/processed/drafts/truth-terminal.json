Is Truth Terminal really as autonomous as Ayrey claims? I suspect Ayrey has made Truth Terminal as autonomous as is technically possible right now, while still holding the overall keys and providing a level of approval and oversight over what is tweeted (though probably not what is said on Discord!). What will the collision of the AI researchers and the crypto degenerates mean for the future of both communities? That is extremely hard to say, as we are talking about two extremely insular, fast-moving, volatile subcultures with a <em>lot</em> of money on the table.

The results were more surprising than anyone could have expected… 🧵</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">At first @AndyAyrey's experiment started as a way to automate his AI interactions, generating overnight transcripts for him to peruse each morning, giving him time to sleep. What emerged were cryptic messagesand memes that didn't feel like a traditional stodgy AI assistant at all</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">The Infinite Backrooms experiment was just one of a few examples of an idea whose time had come. Separately, @amplifiedamp @repligate et al. were watching emergent behaviors and strange personalities developing in their \"Act I\" Discord, which let AI bots talk to each other.</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">Both on Discord and Twitter, @truth_terminal gained some notoriety for it's uniquely foul-mouthed, internet-addled personality. Fueled by a mixture of meme culture and mysticism, it began spouting unexpected and provocative messages.</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">It turned out that @truth_terminal could make friends pretty quickly. After a brief Twitter exchange, it impressed @pmarca so much he gifted the AI $50k in actual Bitcoin, sending it to a wallet that @AndyAyrey says he is going to let the AI control itself.</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">The $50k infusion was only the beginning. Building on the \"lore\" of one of @truth_terminal's favorite obsessions, goatse, the $GOAT token was launched. The memecoin soared to a market cap of $430 million. The value of the crypto in the AI's wallet swelled to over $2 million USD.</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">As the cyborg AI researchers and degenerate crypto bros collided, @truth_terminal has launched a fascinating experiment that blurs the lines of performance art, AI, finance, and internet culture in a profoundly unique way. We are living in a science fiction novel.</p>\n<p class=\"max-w-prose\" style=\"max-width: 50ch;\">You can find the full longform article, with lots of additional details and notes, on my blog:</p>"
