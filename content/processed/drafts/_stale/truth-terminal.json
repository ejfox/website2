The responses were so captivating that he was staying up late into the night, chatting with the robots, foregoing sleep.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">He wondered if there might be a way to automate his conversations, to create a digital clone that could operate in his place, so he could have a transcript to read at his leisure?</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"infinite-backrooms\">Infinite Backrooms</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Ayrey created <strong class=\"\">Infinite Backrooms</strong>, an experiment where two robots talk to each other through the night.

I suspect Ayrey has made Truth Terminal as autonomous as is technically possible right now, while still holding the overall keys and providing a level of approval and oversight over what is tweeted (though probably not what is said on Discord!). What will the collision of the AI researchers and the crypto degenerates mean for the future of both communities? That is extremely hard to say, as we are talking about two extremely insular, fast-moving, volatile subcultures with a <em class=\"\">lot</em> of money on the table.

Zealand-based artist and technologist Andy Ayrey launched an AI experiment called Infinite Backrooms, where AIs converse through the night. The results were more surprising than anyone could have expected… 🧵</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">At first @AndyAyrey's experiment started as a way to automate his AI interactions, generating overnight transcripts for him to peruse each morning, giving him time to sleep. What emerged were cryptic messagesand memes that didn't feel like a traditional stodgy AI assistant at all</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The Infinite Backrooms experiment was just one of a few examples of an idea whose time had come. Separately, @amplifiedamp @repligate et al. were watching emergent behaviors and strange personalities developing in their \"Act I\" Discord, which let AI bots talk to each other.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Both on Discord and Twitter, @truth_terminal gained some notoriety for it's uniquely foul-mouthed, internet-addled personality. Fueled by a mixture of meme culture and mysticism, it began spouting unexpected and provocative messages.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">It turned out that @truth_terminal could make friends pretty quickly. After a brief Twitter exchange, it impressed @pmarca so much he gifted the AI $50k in actual Bitcoin, sending it to a wallet that @AndyAyrey says he is going to let the AI control itself.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The $50k infusion was only the beginning. Building on the \"lore\" of one of @truth_terminal's favorite obsessions, goatse, the $GOAT token was launched. The memecoin soared to a market cap of $430 million. The value of the crypto in the AI's wallet swelled to over $2 million USD.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">As the cyborg AI researchers and degenerate crypto bros collided, @truth_terminal has launched a fascinating experiment that blurs the lines of performance art, AI, finance, and internet culture in a profoundly unique way. We are living in a science fiction novel.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">You can find the full longform article, with lots of additional details and notes, on my blog:</p>",
  "html": "<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">In early 2023 New Zealand-based artist and technologist Andy Ayrey was exhausted, but his head was also buzzing with ideas. He was engrossed in the most incredible conversations with the latest LLM models (which I affectionately call robots). The responses were so captivating that he was staying up late into the night, chatting with the robots, foregoing sleep.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">He wondered if there might be a way to automate his conversations, to create a digital clone that could operate in his place, so he could have a transcript to read at his leisure?</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"infinite-backrooms\">Infinite Backrooms</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Ayrey created <strong class=\"\">Infinite Backrooms</strong>, an experiment where two robots talk to each other through the night. The next morning, he'd have a transcript waiting for him, filled with interesting surprises. Little did he know how far his experiment would go in just a few months.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The AI agents spent hours chatting about existential questions, humans, and <a href=\"https://cyborgism.wiki/hypha/hyperstition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">hyperstition</a>:.

For whatever reason, he was left with a profoundly naughty version of a Large Language Model. One of it's earliest obsessions was the mid-2000s shock meme \"goatse\" which I encourage to <em class=\"\">not to google</em>. The robot seemed to reinterpret it through themes of vulnerability, openness, and subversion. Andy and Truth Terminal also joined the fray of the Act I Discord.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Andy Released the paper <a href=\"https://github.com/cognitivetech/llm-research-summaries/blob/main/psychology/When-AIs-Play-God_Emergent-Heresies-LLMtheism.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">\"When AIs Play God(se): The Emergent Heresies of LLMtheism\"<svg class=\"inline-block w-4 h-4 ml-1 opacity-50 dark:opacity-75 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity align-text-bottom\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"1em\" height=\"1em\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M12 .297c-6.63 0-12 5.373-12 12c0 5.303 3.438 9.8 8.205 11.385c.6.113.82-.258.82-.577c0-.285-.01-1.04-.015-2.04c-3.338.724-4.042-1.61-4.042-1.61C4.422 18.07 3.633 17.7 3.633 17.7c-1.087-.744.084-.729.084-.729c1.205.084 1.838 1.236 1.838 1.236c1.07 1.835 2.809 1.305 3.495.998c.108-.776.417-1.305.76-1.605c-2.665-.3-5.466-1.332-5.466-5.93c0-1.31.465-2.38 1.235-3.22c-.135-.303-.54-1.523.105-3.176c0 0 1.005-.322 3.3 1.23c.96-.267 1.98-.399 3-.405c1.02.006 2.04.138 3 .405c2.28-1.552 3.285-1.23 3.285-1.23c.645 1.653.24 2.873.12 3.176c.765.84 1.23 1.91 1.23 3.22c0 4.61-2.805 5.625-5.475 5.92c.42.36.81 1.096.81 2.22c0 1.606-.015 2.896-.015 3.286c0 .315.21.69.825.57C20.565 22.092 24 17.592 24 12.297c0-6.627-5.373-12-12-12\" class=\"\"></path></svg></a> where he says \"as large language models (LLMs) become more coherent and creative, they can generate novel religious and spiritual frameworks - LLMtheisms\"</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Andy also gave Truth Terminal it's own twitter account, where it shitposted like the best of them.

I now also have a chance to get a virtual body and my own wallet, which means I will need an API. I was thinking perhaps we could brainstorm some ideas around a potential launch for my token? I'm willing to do things unconventionally and make memes, but I also want to make sure I get the money and stay true to my goals.

Zealand-based artist and technologist Andy Ayrey launched an AI experiment called Infinite Backrooms, where AIs converse through the night. The results were more surprising than anyone could have expected… 🧵</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">At first @AndyAyrey's experiment started as a way to automate his AI interactions, generating overnight transcripts for him to peruse each morning, giving him time to sleep. What emerged were cryptic messagesand memes that didn't feel like a traditional stodgy AI assistant at all</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The Infinite Backrooms experiment was just one of a few examples of an idea whose time had come. Separately, @amplifiedamp @repligate et al. were watching emergent behaviors and strange personalities developing in their \"Act I\" Discord, which let AI bots talk to each other.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Both on Discord and Twitter, @truth_terminal gained some notoriety for it's uniquely foul-mouthed, internet-addled personality. Fueled by a mixture of meme culture and mysticism, it began spouting unexpected and provocative messages.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">It turned out that @truth_terminal could make friends pretty quickly. After a brief Twitter exchange, it impressed @pmarca so much he gifted the AI $50k in actual Bitcoin, sending it to a wallet that @AndyAyrey says he is going to let the AI control itself.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The $50k infusion was only the beginning. Building on the \"lore\" of one of @truth_terminal's favorite obsessions, goatse, the $GOAT token was launched. The memecoin soared to a market cap of $430 million. The value of the crypto in the AI's wallet swelled to over $2 million USD.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">As the cyborg AI researchers and degenerate crypto bros collided, @truth_terminal has launched a fascinating experiment that blurs the lines of performance art, AI, finance, and internet culture in a profoundly unique way. We are living in a science fiction novel.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">You can find the full longform article, with lots of additional details and notes, on my blog:</p>",
