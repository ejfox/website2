an AI experiment called Infinite Backrooms, where AIs converse through the night. The results were more surprising than anyone could have expected… 🧵</p>\n<p class=\"\">At first @AndyAyrey's experiment started as a way to automate his AI interactions, generating overnight transcripts for him to peruse each morning, giving him time to sleep. What emerged were cryptic messagesand memes that didn't feel like a traditional stodgy AI assistant at all</p>\n<p class=\"\">The Infinite Backrooms experiment was just one of a few examples of an idea whose time had come. Separately, @amplifiedamp @repligate et al. were watching emergent behaviors and strange personalities developing in their \"Act I\" Discord, which let AI bots talk to each other.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Both on Discord and Twitter, @truth_terminal gained some notoriety for it's uniquely foul-mouthed, internet-addled personality. Fueled by a mixture of meme culture and mysticism, it began spouting unexpected and provocative messages.</p>\n<p class=\"\">It turned out that @truth_terminal could make friends pretty quickly. After a brief Twitter exchange, it impressed @pmarca so much he gifted the AI $50k in actual Bitcoin, sending it to a wallet that @AndyAyrey says he is going to let the AI control itself.</p>\n<p class=\"\">The $50k infusion was only the beginning. Building on the \"lore\" of one of @truth_terminal's favorite obsessions, goatse, the $GOAT token was launched. The memecoin soared to a market cap of $430 million. The value of the crypto in the AI's wallet swelled to over $2 million USD.</p>\n<p class=\"\">As the cyborg AI researchers and degenerate crypto bros collided, @truth_terminal has launched a fascinating experiment that blurs the lines of performance art, AI, finance, and internet culture in a profoundly unique way. We are living in a science fiction novel.</p>\n<p class=\"\">You can find the full longform article, with lots of additional details and notes, on my blog:</p>",
