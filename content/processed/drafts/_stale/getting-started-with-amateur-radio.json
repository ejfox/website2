GMRS transmissions require a $35 license and a callsign which you are required to transmit (either by voice or morse code) at the end of your transmission or every 10 minutes. In some areas of the country there are GMRS repeaters that can extend the range of certain frequencies.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Ham frequencies vary by license level, as you gain higher Ham licensing levels you gain access to more frequencies, higher transmission power, and further distances.
