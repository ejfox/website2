Infinite screen sizes, infinite device types, infinite frameworks, infinite deployment targets. You never know when you're done because there's always another edge case, another optimization, another platform to support.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">PICO-8 is the opposite of that. It's a <em class=\"\">fantasy console</em> with completely artificial limitations:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc ml-6 mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\n<li class=\"\">128x128 pixel screen</li>\n<li class=\"\">16 colors total</li>\n<li class=\"\">4-channel sound</li>\n<li class=\"\">32k code limit</li>\n<li class=\"\">Built-in sprite editor, map editor, sound editor</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">These aren't technical limitations from 1985—they're <em class=\"\">chosen</em> constraints from 2015. And somehow that makes all the difference. When you hit the code limit, you're done. When you've used all 16 colors, you're done. When the screen is 128x128, you don't have to worry about responsive design.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The limitations tell you when you're finished, which is exactly what a scattered brain like mine needs.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"the-miyoo-mini-factor-from-code-to-cartridge\">The Miyoo Mini Factor: From Code to Cartridge</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Here's what completes the magic: I can take that PICO-8 game, transfer it to my Miyoo Mini handheld, and suddenly it exists in the same space as Mega Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Not metaphorically—literally sitting in the same menu, launched the same way, playing with the same physical controls.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">It's like being able to print your novel and put it on the bookshelf next to Hemingway. The medium validates the work in a way that nothing else can.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The workflow is beautifully simple:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal ml-6 mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">\n<li class=\"\">Code in PICO-8 (or VS Code with the PICO-8 extension)</li>\n<li class=\"\">Export to <code class=\"font-mono text-sm bg-zinc-100 dark:bg-zinc-800 rounded px-1.5 py-0.5\">.p8.png</code> file (yes, the game IS the image)</li>\n<li class=\"\">Drop it onto the Miyoo Mini's SD card</li>\n<li class=\"\">Boot up and play</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">No app stores, no certificates, no deployment pipelines.
