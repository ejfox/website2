I'm saying I have the data proving I don't suck, is all.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">But here's the thing: I can't get any of this data anymore. Not the detailed weapon breakdowns, not the mode-specific stats, not even the basic accolades that used to be available. This entire analysis is a fossil from a time when Call of Duty actually let you see what you accomplished in their game. Now? You get a basic K/D and maybe some challenges completed. That's it. This is what we <em class=\"\">used</em> to have access to—imagine that.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"the-hardcore-search--destroy-obsession-remember-when-you-could-actually-see-this\">The Hardcore Search &#x26; Destroy Obsession (Remember When You Could Actually See This?)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Of all the game modes Call of Duty offers, there is only one for the big boys: Hardcore Search &#x26; Destroy. Not the shoot-em-up chaos of Team Deathmatch, not the annoying complexity of Domination—just pure, tactical, one-life-per-round tension.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><strong class=\"\">Hardcore</strong> strips away the safety nets. No minimap, no health regeneration, most guns kill with a single shot anywhere on the body. It forces a completely different kind of awareness—listening for footsteps, watching for movement in peripheral vision, making split-second decisions based on incomplete information. The data shows this translated into a preference for close-quarters combat: a 2.8:1 hipfire-to-ADS kill ratio, suggesting someone who favored reactive engagement over methodical long-range shooting.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><strong class=\"\">Search &#x26; Destroy</strong> is a game mode where one team is tasked with planting a bomb, and the other team must try to stop them. If the bomb is planted, the other team must then try to defuse it. If the bomb detonates, or all members of one team are killed, that team will lose. Once you are dead, you cannot respawn until the next round. In my historical data for Hardcore Search I had 1,165 bomb plants and 220 defuses, a 5.3:1 ratio. But that's it—that's all I have. That number might as well be carved in stone because there's no way to see how it's changed, no way to break it down by map or teammate, no way to understand what made me successful or what I could improve.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Hardcore Search has more tactical gameplay and attracts a different player base than the default modes, and has had a cult following throughout much of the history of the Call of Duty franchise.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"communication-and-callouts\">Communication and callouts</h4>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">One of the reasons I like Hardcore Search is that it tests your ability to play as a team, and makes an incentive to play with the same people over time. Communication and coordination are key, and one player going rogue can cost the entire team the match. It's a fast paced game mode. When you are the last player alive on your team, everyone is watching you, and you if you have an opportunity to save the round your heart will start racing. What a good video game.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">That moment when your team is eliminated and you're suddenly in a 1v4 clutch situation and your heart is beating? I thrive in those moments. The data bears this out: 322 comeback kills and 267 avenger kill accolades—situational awareness and patience under pressure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"playing-with-a-friend\">Playing with a friend</h2>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">I think one of the best ways to enjoy Call of Duty is to play with a friend. I've had some of the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my life playing with friends and randos and it's a great way to bond and catch up with friends who don't live nearby. But try proving that statistically. Want to see how your team performance differs when playing with regular teammates vs. randoms? Activision won't let you. Want to analyze which friend combinations work best for different game modes? Good luck accessing that data.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Playing with friends also allows you to communicate and coordinate more effectively, which can be a huge advantage in a fast paced and competitive game like Call of Duty. The numbers show this partnership approach working: 761 smoke grenades deployed and 203 snapshot grenades landed suggest someone constantly feeding intel to teammates, creating opportunities for coordinated pushes and defensive setups. Imagine if you could track how often those utilities actually led to team kills, or which teammates benefit most from your support play. That's the kind of insight that would make Call of Duty genuinely addictive for data nerds like me—but apparently that's too much to ask for.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"the-riot-shield-meta-when-data-meets-trolling-but-the-data-is-incomplete\">The Riot Shield Meta: When Data Meets Trolling (But the Data Is Incomplete)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The riot shield is basically a giant bulletproof rectangle that you carry instead of a primary weapon. Most players see it as a meme weapon, something for trolling or griefing. But in Hardcore Search &#x26; Destroy, it becomes this fascinating tactical tool that completely changes the dynamics of the game. Of course, with today's limited data access, I can't show you the full picture—like how shield usage affects round win rates, or whether teams perform better with one dedicated shield player versus none.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The shield forces a playstyle based on patience, positioning, and game IQ rather than the usual run-and-gun tactics. You become the team's mobile cover, creating angles for teammates, blocking off chokepoints, soaking up damage while someone else gets the actual kills. In Search and Destroy, when you're defending a planted bomb, having someone with a riot shield hold an angle can be the difference between a round win and a heartbreaking loss.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">It's also psychological warfare. Nothing tilts aggressive players quite like getting \"booped\" to death by someone with a shield. People have called me terrible things. The weapon usage data shows I was committed to this bit for <em class=\"\">years</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">My riot shield stats are absolutely brutal: 1,610 kills but 6,559 deaths, giving me a catastrophic 0.25 K/D ratio with the shield. Every death while holding the shield was time bought for teammates, angles created, enemy attention diverted. And you know what would be amazing? If I could correlate those shield deaths with teammate success rates, or track how often my \"sacrifice\" plays actually won rounds, but unfortunately that data just isn't available anymore.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"the-pistol-paradox-when-secondary-becomes-primary\">The Pistol Paradox: When Secondary Becomes Primary</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The shield use means that most of my actual work is done with a pistol. While most players treat pistols as backup weapons, my stats tell a different story. The Desert Eagle (.50 cal) shows 5,094 kills with a respectable 1.15 K/D ratio—better than many players manage with primary weapons, and often after being quickly whipped out from behind a riot shield.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">18,765 Deagle shots fired with a 26% accuracy rate and 636 headshots. In Hardcore mode, where most weapons kill in one hit anyway, the traditional weapon hierarchy breaks down. A well-placed pistol shot is just as lethal as an assault rifle burst, but infinitely more satisfying.</p>\n<h2 class=\"text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"the-numbers-dont-lie-a-decade-of-virtual-combat\">The Numbers Don't Lie: A Decade of Virtual Combat</h2>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">30,451 kills and 32,507 deaths gives me a 0.94 K/D ratio—just slightly underwater, but you have to understand I'm mostly playing Search.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The win-loss ratio tells the story I'm most proud of: 2,007 wins against 2,591 losses (77.5% win rate). This isn't individual glory—this is team play. My longest win streak was 11 games, and my best single-match performance was 69 kills (probably TDM).</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\"

class=\"\">Pistol Mastery in a Primary World:</strong> A 1.15 K/D with the Desert Eagle is respectable.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><strong class=\"\">Objective Obsession:</strong> The 5.3:1 plant-to-defuse ratio reveals an aggressive, site-taking playstyle. I wasn't the guy hiding in corners waiting for enemies to come to me—I was the one pushing objectives and forcing action.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><strong class=\"\">The Reactive Fighter:</strong> That 2.8:1 hipfire-to-ADS ratio shows someone who favored close-quarters encounters over long-range camping. In Hardcore mode, the first person to fire usually wins, so this ratio suggests quick reflexes and aggressive positioning.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"the-muscle-memory-years\">The Muscle Memory Years</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">I've been at this since 2007 with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare—back when the series still felt revolutionary rather than iterative. What keeps pulling me back isn't nostalgia; it's the almost indescribable sense of flow that comes from having put hundreds of hours into the same maps, the same mechanics, the same split-second decision trees.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">When old remastered levels come out, it's like returning to a childhood neighborhood where every shortcut and hiding spot is burned into muscle memory. You don't think about where to pre-aim or when to reload—your hands just know. After this much time investment, I'm basically locked into the series whether I want to be or not.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"killcam-culture-style-points-and-psychological-warfare\">Killcam Culture: Style Points and Psychological Warfare</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">One of the aspects of the Call of Duty community that I find most interesting is the killcam culture. A killcam is a short replay that is shown after the last kill of the round, and it allows players to see how they died from the perspective of the person who killed them.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The killcam has become a meme within the community, and veteran players will often do outrageous things in an attempt to get a funny or impressive killcam, kind of like flipping your bat after a home run or dancing after a touchdown.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">My 246 throwing knife kills were pure killcam bait. There's nothing more demoralizing than watching yourself get eliminated by a perfectly arced blade when the enemy had access to assault rifles and explosives. It's the gaming equivalent of choosing to paint with watercolors when you could just use a camera—completely impractical, absolutely satisfying, and guaranteed to tilt the opposition.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The same philosophy applied to my melee game: 519 melee kills across thousands of matches meant I was regularly choosing to get up close and personal in a game designed around gunfights. Sometimes the most effective psychological weapon is simply refusing to play by conventional rules.</p>",

After all that I had a<a href=\"https://observablehq.com/d/ebcb9d412e80ee68\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">0.94 overall K/D ratio alongside a 77.5% win rate<svg class=\"inline-block w-4 h-4 ml-1 opacity-50 dark:opacity-75 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity align-text-bottom\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"1em\" height=\"1em\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M12 20q-1.597 0-2.77-.696a4.7 4.7 0 0 1-1.794-1.89a10 10 0 0 1-.916-2.53A13.6 13.6 0 0 1 6.23 12q0-1.149.152-2.2q.15-1.049.556-2.132A6.8 6.8 0 0 1 7.98 5.79a4.7 4.7 0 0 1 1.668-1.293Q10.681 4 12 4q1.597 0 2.77.696a4.7 4.7 0 0 1 1.794 1.89q.627 1.193.916 2.53T17.77 12q0 1.149-.152 2.2a9.8 9.8 0 0 1-.567 2.132a7.2 7.2 0 0 1-1.042 1.878q-.627.796-1.657 1.293q-1.031.498-2.352.497m2.037-5.882c.551-.554.858-1.32.848-2.118q0-1.236-.827-2.118Q13.23 9 12 9t-2.058.882A3 3 0 0 0 9.115 12q0 1.236.827 2.118Q10.77 15 12 15t2.037-.882M12 24c6.372 0 11.538-5.373 11.538-12S18.372 0 12 0S.462 5.373.462 12S5.628 24 12 24\" class=\"\"></path></svg></a>. I'm saying I have the data proving I don't suck, is all.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">But here's the thing: I can't get any of this data anymore. Not the detailed weapon breakdowns, not the mode-specific stats, not even the basic accolades that used to be available. This entire analysis is a fossil from a time when Call of Duty actually let you see what you accomplished in their game. Now? You get a basic K/D and maybe some challenges completed. That's it. This is what we <em class=\"\">used</em> to have access to—imagine that.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"the-hardcore-search--destroy-obsession-remember-when-you-could-actually-see-this\">The Hardcore Search &#x26; Destroy Obsession (Remember When You Could Actually See This?)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Of all the game modes Call of Duty offers, there is only one for the big boys: Hardcore Search &#x26; Destroy. Not the shoot-em-up chaos of Team Deathmatch, not the annoying complexity of Domination—just pure, tactical, one-life-per-round tension.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><strong class=\"\">Hardcore</strong> strips away the safety nets. No minimap, no health regeneration, most guns kill with a single shot anywhere on the body. It forces a completely different kind of awareness—listening for footsteps, watching for movement in peripheral vision, making split-second decisions based on incomplete information. The data shows this translated into a preference for close-quarters combat: a 2.8:1 hipfire-to-ADS kill ratio, suggesting someone who favored reactive engagement over methodical long-range shooting.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><strong class=\"\">Search &#x26; Destroy</strong> is a game mode where one team is tasked with planting a bomb, and the other team must try to stop them. If the bomb is planted, the other team must then try to defuse it. If the bomb detonates, or all members of one team are killed, that team will lose. Once you are dead, you cannot respawn until the next round. In my historical data for Hardcore Search I had 1,165 bomb plants and 220 defuses, a 5.3:1 ratio. But that's it—that's all I have. That number might as well be carved in stone because there's no way to see how it's changed, no way to break it down by map or teammate, no way to understand what made me successful or what I could improve.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Hardcore Search has more tactical gameplay and attracts a different player base than the default modes, and has had a cult following throughout much of the history of the Call of Duty franchise.</p>\n<h4 class=\"\" id=\"communication-and-callouts\">Communication and callouts</h4>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">One of the reasons I like Hardcore Search is that it tests your ability to play as a team, and makes an incentive to play with the same people over time. Communication and coordination are key, and one player going rogue can cost the entire team the match. It's a fast paced game mode. When you are the last player alive on your team, everyone is watching you, and you if you have an opportunity to save the round your heart will start racing. What a good video game.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">That moment when your team is eliminated and you're suddenly in a 1v4 clutch situation and your heart is beating? I thrive in those moments. The data bears this out: 322 comeback kills and 267 avenger kill accolades—situational awareness and patience under pressure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"playing-with-a-friend\">Playing with a friend</h2>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">I think one of the best ways to enjoy Call of Duty is to play with a friend. I've had some of the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my life playing with friends and randos and it's a great way to bond and catch up with friends who don't live nearby. But try proving that statistically. Want to see how your team performance differs when playing with regular teammates vs. randoms? Activision won't let you. Want to analyze which friend combinations work best for different game modes? Good luck accessing that data.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">Playing with friends also allows you to communicate and coordinate more effectively, which can be a huge advantage in a fast paced and competitive game like Call of Duty. The numbers show this partnership approach working: 761 smoke grenades deployed and 203 snapshot grenades landed suggest someone constantly feeding intel to teammates, creating opportunities for coordinated pushes and defensive setups. Imagine if you could track how often those utilities actually led to team kills, or which teammates benefit most from your support play. That's the kind of insight that would make Call of Duty genuinely addictive for data nerds like me—but apparently that's too much to ask for.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"the-riot-shield-meta-when-data-meets-trolling-but-the-data-is-incomplete\">The Riot Shield Meta: When Data Meets Trolling (But the Data Is Incomplete)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The riot shield is basically a giant bulletproof rectangle that you carry instead of a primary weapon. Most players see it as a meme weapon, something for trolling or griefing. But in Hardcore Search &#x26; Destroy, it becomes this fascinating tactical tool that completely changes the dynamics of the game. Of course, with today's limited data access, I can't show you the full picture—like how shield usage affects round win rates, or whether teams perform better with one dedicated shield player versus none.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The shield forces a playstyle based on patience, positioning, and game IQ rather than the usual run-and-gun tactics. You become the team's mobile cover, creating angles for teammates, blocking off chokepoints, soaking up damage while someone else gets the actual kills. In Search and Destroy, when you're defending a planted bomb, having someone with a riot shield hold an angle can be the difference between a round win and a heartbreaking loss.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">It's also psychological warfare. Nothing tilts aggressive players quite like getting \"booped\" to death by someone with a shield. People have called me terrible things. The weapon usage data shows I was committed to this bit for <em class=\"\">years</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">My riot shield stats are absolutely brutal: 1,610 kills but 6,559 deaths, giving me a catastrophic 0.25 K/D ratio with the shield. Every death while holding the shield was time bought for teammates, angles created, enemy attention diverted. And you know what would be amazing? If I could correlate those shield deaths with teammate success rates, or track how often my \"sacrifice\" plays actually won rounds, but unfortunately that data just isn't available anymore.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"the-pistol-paradox-when-secondary-becomes-primary\">The Pistol Paradox: When Secondary Becomes Primary</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The shield use means that most of my actual work is done with a pistol. While most players treat pistols as backup weapons, my stats tell a different story. The Desert Eagle (.50 cal) shows 5,094 kills with a respectable 1.15 K/D ratio—better than many players manage with primary weapons, and often after being quickly whipped out from behind a riot shield.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">18,765 Deagle shots fired with a 26% accuracy rate and 636 headshots. In Hardcore mode, where most weapons kill in one hit anyway, the traditional weapon hierarchy breaks down. A well-placed pistol shot is just as lethal as an assault rifle burst, but infinitely more satisfying.</p>\n<h2 class=\"text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"the-numbers-dont-lie-a-decade-of-virtual-combat\">The Numbers Don't Lie: A Decade of Virtual Combat</h2>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">30,451 kills and 32,507 deaths gives me a 0.94 K/D ratio—just slightly underwater, but you have to understand I'm mostly playing Search.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The win-loss ratio tells the story I'm most proud of: 2,007 wins against 2,591 losses (77.5% win rate). This isn't individual glory—this is team play. My longest win streak was 11 games, and my best single-match performance was 69 kills (probably TDM).</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\"

class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The numbers paint a picture of someone playing an entirely different game than most Call of Duty players:</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><strong class=\"\">Pistol Mastery in a Primary World:</strong> A 1.15 K/D with the Desert Eagle is respectable.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><strong class=\"\">Objective Obsession:</strong> The 5.3:1 plant-to-defuse ratio reveals an aggressive, site-taking playstyle. I wasn't the guy hiding in corners waiting for enemies to come to me—I was the one pushing objectives and forcing action.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\"><strong class=\"\">The Reactive Fighter:</strong> That 2.8:1 hipfire-to-ADS ratio shows someone who favored close-quarters encounters over long-range camping. In Hardcore mode, the first person to fire usually wins, so this ratio suggests quick reflexes and aggressive positioning.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"the-muscle-memory-years\">The Muscle Memory Years</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">I've been at this since 2007 with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare—back when the series still felt revolutionary rather than iterative. What keeps pulling me back isn't nostalgia; it's the almost indescribable sense of flow that comes from having put hundreds of hours into the same maps, the same mechanics, the same split-second decision trees.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">When old remastered levels come out, it's like returning to a childhood neighborhood where every shortcut and hiding spot is burned into muscle memory. You don't think about where to pre-aim or when to reload—your hands just know. After this much time investment, I'm basically locked into the series whether I want to be or not.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose mx-auto font-sans\" id=\"killcam-culture-style-points-and-psychological-warfare\">Killcam Culture: Style Points and Psychological Warfare</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">One of the aspects of the Call of Duty community that I find most interesting is the killcam culture. A killcam is a short replay that is shown after the last kill of the round, and it allows players to see how they died from the perspective of the person who killed them.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The killcam has become a meme within the community, and veteran players will often do outrageous things in an attempt to get a funny or impressive killcam, kind of like flipping your bat after a home run or dancing after a touchdown.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">My 246 throwing knife kills were pure killcam bait. There's nothing more demoralizing than watching yourself get eliminated by a perfectly arced blade when the enemy had access to assault rifles and explosives. It's the gaming equivalent of choosing to paint with watercolors when you could just use a camera—completely impractical, absolutely satisfying, and guaranteed to tilt the opposition.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 max-w-prose mx-auto\">The same philosophy applied to my melee game: 519 melee kills across thousands of matches meant I was regularly choosing to get up close and personal in a game designed around gunfights. Sometimes the most effective psychological weapon is simply refusing to play by conventional rules.</p>",
