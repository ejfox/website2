Little did I know I would spend the rest of my life doing basically this same thing on very different scales.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">—</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In 2011, at 19 years old, I moved across the country to Oakland and began working at my first start-up, who had found me through a viral Flickr infographic I had done and was impressed with my ability to manipulate SVG with javascript, which is what they had in mind for the product they had raised $2M to build. I had been accepted to art school, but decided to defer for a year, thinking that moving to a state where weed was legal and getting <em class=\"\">paid</em> instead of <em class=\"\">paying</em> might be slightly more fun.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">I found myself at meetups and hackathons in the offices of companies whose products I had used every day but had only ever seen as virtual logos on my computer. The vibe was almost exactly the same as those cafeterias and computer labs back at ID Tech, and it was easy for me to feel at home surrounded by smart people who primarily wanted to build things and were willing to teach me.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">—</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Almost everyone innately saw the benefits of interoperability. We built tools that stood on top of each other, and websites like Flickr, Wikipedia, and Twitter positioned themselves as central shared databases that everyone could add to and pull from depending on their needs. I felt the power of this viscerally when I saw the Jonathan Harris/Sep Kamvar work <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/196071\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">We Feel Fine (2009)</a> which scraped recent blog entries for the phrase “I feel…” and visualizing them together in a beautiful visualization. Part of the work is itself the API they created, with the authors saying “Borrowing is a great tradition in art; each individual piece of art is part of a larger conversation. With technology-based art, we have the ability to enable borrowing more directly by opening up APIs to our work. Accordingly, we have opened up <a href=\"http://wefeelfine.org/api.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">an API</a> for We Feel Fine, to allow other artists to more easily make pieces that explore these human emotions.”</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">—</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Somewhere, in the intervening years, the vibe has shifted dramatically. The coolest artists I know post most of their content to Instagram, an app run by a company worth over a trillion dollars. Instagram does not make it easy to get your data, photos, or followers <em class=\"\">out</em> of Instagram, which makes sense, because they have every incentive to get you to stay and spend a few more precious seconds on their app.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Those seconds will be converted to money, as they covertly fill your feed with ads hyper-tailored to the interests they have gleaned from the photos you scroll more slowly over. These seconds can also be utilized as political capital by various product managers angling for a new house in Tahoe whose OKRs often directly correlate to how addicted their users are.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The value of picking up your phone, pointing it at something interesting, and all of your friends being able to see it and talk to you about it is clearly very high, but the price we are paying for it is not only extraordinary but unnecessary.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">—</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><a href=\"https://interconnected.org/home/2024/08/09/no-apps-no-masters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">https://interconnected.org/home/2024/08/09/no-apps-no-masters</a></p>",

Little did I know I would spend the rest of my life doing basically this same thing on very different scales.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">—</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In 2011, at 19 years old, I moved across the country to Oakland and began working at my first start-up, who had found me through a viral Flickr infographic I had done and was impressed with my ability to manipulate SVG with javascript, which is what they had in mind for the product they had raised $2M to build. I had been accepted to art school, but decided to defer for a year, thinking that moving to a state where weed was legal and getting <em class=\"\">paid</em> instead of <em class=\"\">paying</em> might be slightly more fun.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">I found myself at meetups and hackathons in the offices of companies whose products I had used every day but had only ever seen as virtual logos on my computer. The vibe was almost exactly the same as those cafeterias and computer labs back at ID Tech, and it was easy for me to feel at home surrounded by smart people who primarily wanted to build things and were willing to teach me.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">—</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Almost everyone innately saw the benefits of interoperability. We built tools that stood on top of each other, and websites like Flickr, Wikipedia, and Twitter positioned themselves as central shared databases that everyone could add to and pull from depending on their needs. I felt the power of this viscerally when I saw the Jonathan Harris/Sep Kamvar work <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/196071\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">We Feel Fine (2009)</a> which scraped recent blog entries for the phrase “I feel…” and visualizing them together in a beautiful visualization. Part of the work is itself the API they created, with the authors saying “Borrowing is a great tradition in art; each individual piece of art is part of a larger conversation. With technology-based art, we have the ability to enable borrowing more directly by opening up APIs to our work. Accordingly, we have opened up <a href=\"http://wefeelfine.org/api.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">an API</a> for We Feel Fine, to allow other artists to more easily make pieces that explore these human emotions.”</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">—</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Somewhere, in the intervening years, the vibe has shifted dramatically. The coolest artists I know post most of their content to Instagram, an app run by a company worth over a trillion dollars. Instagram does not make it easy to get your data, photos, or followers <em class=\"\">out</em> of Instagram, which makes sense, because they have every incentive to get you to stay and spend a few more precious seconds on their app.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Those seconds will be converted to money, as they covertly fill your feed with ads hyper-tailored to the interests they have gleaned from the photos you scroll more slowly over. These seconds can also be utilized as political capital by various product managers angling for a new house in Tahoe whose OKRs often directly correlate to how addicted their users are.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The value of picking up your phone, pointing it at something interesting, and all of your friends being able to see it and talk to you about it is clearly very high, but the price we are paying for it is not only extraordinary but unnecessary.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">—</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><a href=\"https://interconnected.org/home/2024/08/09/no-apps-no-masters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link group inline-flex items-center text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400\">https://interconnected.org/home/2024/08/09/no-apps-no-masters</a></p>",
