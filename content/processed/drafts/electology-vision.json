  "content": "<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">I'm excited to tell you about Electology, my passion project that brings together everything I've learned and wanted to achieve in the realm of election data visualization and analysis. After working at NBC News and creating the app used by Steve Kornacki for live election coverage, I decided to take all the ideas and features I couldn't implement there and build something even better on my own. That's how Electology was born.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Electology has two main components. The first is a touchscreen application designed for TV anchors to use during election nights. This app allows them to show not only live election results but also delve into historical data to tell compelling stories about the elections. What makes this touchscreen app unique is that it uses web technology and powerful data visualization libraries. This means it's fully extensible and can be customized to match the graphic styles of any network, which is a huge plus for major clients like NBC or CBS who have specific styling and colors for their graphics packages.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">One of the things I'm really proud of is our ability to create advanced data visualizations. We have everything from swing arrows and scatter plots to bivariate choropleth maps. These unique visualizations help tell intricate stories about election data that other tools just can't match, with visuals that are broadcast-ready at all times.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">The second component of Electology is our digital maps, which news outlets can embed directly into their websites. These maps stand out because they offer incredibly high-resolution results, down to the precinct level wherever possible. We also integrate as much historical and demographic data analysis to give crucial context to emerging stories. This level of detail is a key part of accurate analysis and storytelling.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Another core approach is our AI-augmented data-driven sentences. These are text displays that highlight the most important insights in various geographic regions, helping users understand the data better and identify outliers or changes. We've also enhanced these sentences with LLMs to incorporate large datasets of historical and demographic results, providing deeper context and explanations.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">We also incorporate a wealth of historical election data from sources like the MIT Media Lab and FEC campaign finance data, alongside demographic data from the Census Bureau. This comprehensive collection of data allows users to analyze trends and patterns without making outright predictions about future outcomes. Instead, we provide a range of analysis tools so users can make their own informed assumptions and predictions.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">At Electology, we trust you to get the data. We cut out the fluff and give you direct access to the raw numbers, no middleman.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Electology is about empowering users with the tools and data they need to understand and analyze elections deeply. Whether it's a TV anchor needing to explain what's happening in real-time or a news outlet looking to provide their audience with interactive maps, Electology has something to offer.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">I'm constantly refining and improving Electology, and I'm excited about its future. There are always new features and improvements on the horizon, and I'm thrilled to see how it will continue to evolve and help people make sense of election data.</p>\n<h3 class=\"prose-lg text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose md:pr-12 animate-on-scroll slide-from-left\" id=\"touchscreen-application\">Touchscreen Application</h3>\n<ul class=\"prose-lg list-disc list-outside ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2 max-w-prose\">\n<li class=\"prose-lg max-w-prose\"><strong class=\"\">Web Technology</strong>: Uses powerful data visualization libraries like D3 and WebGL for full customization.</li>\n<li class=\"prose-lg max-w-prose\"><strong class=\"\">Broadcast Integration</strong>: Can match any network's graphic style and integrate with broadcast systems like VizRT</li>\n<li class=\"prose-lg max-w-prose\"><strong class=\"\">Advanced Visualizations</strong>: Includes swing arrows, scatter plots, and bivariate choropleth maps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"prose-lg text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose md:pr-12 animate-on-scroll slide-from-left\" id=\"digital-maps\">Digital Maps</h3>\n<ul class=\"prose-lg list-disc list-outside ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2 max-w-prose\">\n<li class=\"prose-lg max-w-prose\"><strong class=\"\">High Resolution</strong>: Detailed results down to the precinct level wherever possible</li>\n<li class=\"prose-lg max-w-prose\"><strong class=\"\">Embeddable</strong>: Easy integration into news websites and client content management systems</li>\n<li class=\"prose-lg max-w-prose\"><strong class=\"\">User-Friendly</strong>: A strong emphasis on intuitive design that can accommodate a spectrum of user expertise.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"prose-lg text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose md:pr-12 animate-on-scroll slide-from-left\" id=\"data-integration\">Data Integration</h3>\n<ul class=\"prose-lg list-disc list-outside ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2 max-w-prose\">\n<li class=\"prose-lg max-w-prose\"><strong class=\"\">Historical Data</strong>: Election data from the MIT Media Lab and FEC campaign finance data.</li>\n<li class=\"prose-lg max-w-prose\"><strong class=\"\">Demographic Data</strong>: Analyzes trends using Census Bureau data.</li>\n<li class=\"prose-lg max-w-prose\"><strong class=\"\">Performance</strong>: Optimized to handle high-resolution data seamlessly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"prose-lg text-2xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6 max-w-prose md:pr-12 animate-on-scroll slide-from-left\" id=\"analysis-tools\">Analysis Tools</h3>\n<ul class=\"prose-lg list-disc list-outside ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2 max-w-prose\">\n<li class=\"prose-lg max-w-prose\"><strong class=\"\">Custom Analysis</strong>: Tools for users to explore, visualize, and share their own predictions.</li>\n<li class=\"prose-lg max-w-prose\"><strong class=\"\">Data-Driven Sentences</strong>: Reiterates key insights from visualizations automatically, increasing user engagement and approachability</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Electology handles the immense scale of historical live and election data with a robust and innovative infrastructure. By leveraging technologies like Netlify Edge functions and CloudFlare workers, we ensure that our processes run efficiently at the edge, significantly reducing latency and improving performance during peak times.

This method ensures consistent and responsive data visualization across devices even under heavy loads, making Electology reliable and fast during critical election moments.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Accuracy and timeliness of data are at the heart of Electology. All year long we are continuously updating precinct boundaries and demographic data by sourcing from various projects and sources. This ongoing effort guarantees that our users always have access to the most current and precise election information. Our commitment to maintaining up-to-date datasets underscores the value we are providing our users, who would otherwise need to be doing this constant upkeep themselves.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Customization and ease of use are central to Electology's design. By utilizing familiar web technologies, we've made the system highly accessible to newsrooms with web development capabilities. We have also created a number of tools that allow for easy integration into OBS, so that you can easily livestream of create videos with a variety of broadcast-friendly realtime data visualizations.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">Our modular approach allows for quick adjustments and last-minute changes, essential for the dynamic environment of live news coverage.

Our focus is on providing accurate and accessible election data, ensuring that users can trust the information they receive without worrying about sensitive data breaches.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">We ensure the accuracy and reduce the bias in our AI-enhanced data-driven sentences through rigorous testing and a controlled approach. By using historical data extensively to validate our models and adopting a Mad Libs-style method where the AI repeats specific data fed to it, we mitigate the risk of inaccuracies and biases. This approach ensures that our users receive factual and reliable information, enhancing their understanding of election data.</p>\n<p class=\"prose-p prose-lg max-w-prose mb-4 leading-relaxed dark:prose-invert animate-on-scroll\" style=\"max-width: 60ch;\">While Electology isn't fully open source, we believe in the power of transparency and release portions of our code to the community and work in the open as much as possible.
