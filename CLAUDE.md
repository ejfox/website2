# Docker Deployment Prep - Detailed Progress Log

## What We're Doing
Converting this Nuxt 3 website from Netlify deployment to Docker-based deployment. The main challenge is that this project uses the `canvas` npm package for OG image generation, which requires native system dependencies that are complex to install in Docker containers.

## Current Status: âœ… DOCKER BUILD SUCCESSFUL! 
The Docker image builds successfully and the container runs with health checks working properly. The site is accessible on port 3006.

## Progress So Far

### âœ… COMPLETED
1. **Docker Configuration Files Created**
   - `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build with Alpine Linux base
   - `.dockerignore` - Excludes unnecessary files from build context
   - `docker-compose.yml` - Production deployment config with health checks
   - `server/api/healthcheck.get.ts` - Health endpoint for container monitoring

2. **Nuxt Config Updated for Docker**
   - Changed preset from `netlify` to `node-server`
   - Added Docker-friendly host/port settings
   - Kept dev port as 3006 (per user request)

3. **Netlify Cleanup**
   - Removed `netlify.toml` file
   - Removed `netlify/` directory
   - Confirmed no Netlify dependencies in package.json

4. **Canvas Dependencies Solved**
   - Added all required Alpine packages for canvas: `cairo-dev`, `jpeg-dev`, `pango-dev`, etc.
   - Multi-stage build separates build-time deps from runtime deps
   - Both build and production stages have appropriate canvas libraries

### âœ… RESOLVED: Build Issues Fixed
**Fixed Issues**:
- `components/prediction/PredictionCard.vue` - Already had `lang="ts"`
- `components/prediction/VerificationDisplay.vue` - Already had `lang="ts"`
- `components/PostMetadata.vue` - Already had `lang="ts"`
- `server/api/search.get.ts` - Fixed duplicate `slug` variable declaration (line 171)

**Note**: The TypeScript interface errors were already fixed. The actual blocker was a duplicate variable declaration in the search API.

### ðŸ”§ Build Process Details
1. **Dependencies**: ~380MB of Alpine packages install successfully
2. **Yarn Install**: All npm dependencies install without errors (canvas compiles correctly)
3. **Build Success**: Nuxt build completes successfully in ~47 seconds
4. **Container Size**: Final image includes all runtime dependencies for canvas
5. **Health Check**: Container starts successfully with working health endpoint

## Next Steps (In Order)
1. âœ… ~~Fix duplicate variable declaration~~
2. âœ… ~~Complete Docker build test~~
3. âœ… ~~Test container startup and health check~~
4. Create `.env.example` with all environment variables
5. Deploy to VPS with proper environment variables
6. Set up reverse proxy (nginx/caddy) for domain routing
7. Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployments

## Docker Best Practices Applied
- Multi-stage build to minimize final image size
- Non-root user for security
- Health checks for monitoring
- Proper caching layers for fast rebuilds
- All canvas runtime dependencies in production stage

## Key Commands
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t website2-test .

# Run container
docker run -p 3006:3000 website2-test

# Health check
curl http://localhost:3006/api/healthcheck
```

## Issues Encountered & Solutions
1. **Missing git**: Added to Alpine packages for npm dependencies
2. **Canvas compilation**: Added full suite of Alpine dev packages
3. **TypeScript in Vue**: Components already had `lang="ts"` - false alarm
4. **Duplicate variable**: Fixed duplicate `slug` declaration in search.get.ts
5. **Port configuration**: Successfully mapped 3006 external â†’ 3000 internal

## Why This Was Frustrating
- Canvas package requires extensive native dependencies
- Alpine Linux package names differ from Debian/Ubuntu
- Vue TypeScript compilation is strict about interface usage
- Multiple dependency layers (system â†’ npm â†’ build â†’ runtime)

## Deployment Commands for VPS

```bash
# On your local machine - push image to registry
docker tag website2-test your-registry.com/website2:latest
docker push your-registry.com/website2:latest

# On VPS - pull and run
docker pull your-registry.com/website2:latest
docker run -d \
  --name website2 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3006:3000 \
  --env-file .env \
  your-registry.com/website2:latest
```
