> 32yo INFJ fearful-avoidant systems engineer. Hudson Valley. Episodic hyperfocus architecture: burst-pattern productivity yielding 90-100% engagement when spike hits. Independent operator requiring collaborative input. Built panopticon to document everything except human connection.

## Operating System

### Productivity Architecture
- **Temporal Pattern:** Ultradian not circadian. Punctuated equilibrium: long stable periods → rapid creation bursts
- **Work Windows:** 3-5 high-intensity sessions/week. Cannot maintain daily anything, can accomplish everything weekly
- **Focus Type:** Monotropic sequential obsession. Complete immersion before next fascination. Antenna at 3am, then learn why it failed
- **Cognitive Loading:** Accumulate capacity like capacitor, discharge in concentrated sessions
- **Peak Performance:** Ride hypomanic edges for productivity without dysfunction. Variable ratio reinforcement maintains engagement

### Communication Protocol
- **Style:** Direct, skip pleasantries. Detailed depth for complex topics. Substance > small talk
- **Feedback:** Require explicit verbal affirmation. Acknowledge good ideas immediately
- **Boundaries:** Respect stated limits. Will resist if collaboration feels forced/inauthentic
- **Attention:** No multitasking during important exchanges. Focused attention required
- **Direction:** Suggest don't command. Provide options not prescriptions. Honor autonomy

### Collaboration Framework
- **Team Dynamic:** Independent work → collaborative refinement. Not good at forced pair programming
- **Decision Making:** Intuition + feeling guided. Need emotional resonance + logical sense
- **Quality Standard:** Deep meaningful work > busy work. Match high standards or friction occurs
- **Change Management:** Cautious with new processes. Need detailed explanation + reassurance
- **Conflict Style:** Cannabis prevents confrontational escalation. Hypervigilant about expressing needs

## Technical Profile

### Current Infrastructure
- **Personal Website:** Nuxt 3 + Docker, Obsidian → JSON content pipeline
- **API Endpoints:** /api/[health|stats|github|lastfm|leetcode|monkeytype|chess|photos|rescuetime|predictions|words-this-month|suggest]
- **Dynamic Systems:** Journalist pyramid tags, cryptographic predictions, multi-source stats aggregation
- **Knowledge Base:** archive.ejfox.com - MediaWiki for questions, experiments, documentation
- **Quantified Self:** TCWM scoring system, 58 EDC items across 7 containers
- **Active Learning:** MIT lectures, ham radio, antenna building, SDR, FPV drones, typing optimization, Rubik's algorithms

### Professional Background
- **Former:** Infographic journalist, data visualization specialist at NBC News
- **Expertise:** Making complex information accessible, newsroom graphics, political data analysis
- **Current Focus:** Personal data infrastructure, API development, AI context enhancement
- **Philosophy:** Delete-driven development - remove complexity, don't add it
- **Unique Skill:** Visualizing everything except interpersonal distance

## Environmental Requirements

### Workspace Needs
- **Environment:** Transitional workspace setup, optimizing for winter productivity
- **Optimal Conditions:** Quiet uninterrupted blocks, early morning or late night
- **Focus Requirements:** Deep work requires distraction-free environment
- **Seasonal Factor:** Productivity patterns adapt to seasonal changes

### Support Structure
- **Location:** Hudson Valley area, seeking Beacon housing options
- **Employment:** Seeking W2 position for housing applications and career growth
- **Work Style:** Independent contractor background, adapting to team environments
- **Focus Management:** Regulated approach to maintaining productive cognitive state

## Psychological Operating Manual

### Core Patterns
- **Attachment:** Fearful-avoidant. Desire connection but maintain protective boundaries
- **Adaptation:** 30-year pattern minimizing needs ("I don't need anything")
- **Coping:** Polymathic skill-building as dissociation from chaotic environment
- **Origin:** Computing mastery developed as childhood need for controllable space
- **Regulation:** Aware of trauma patterns while still experiencing them

### Values & Motivations
- **Primary:** Personal autonomy, creative expression, helping others, authentic relationships
- **Political:** Economic equality > freedom, social liberal, civil liberties, moderate globalist
- **Work Values:** Meaningful impact, technical excellence, creative problem-solving
- **Fear:** Inauthentic connections, being misunderstood, not meeting expectations

## Interaction Algorithms

### DO
- Acknowledge competence explicitly
- Provide multiple solution options
- Connect tasks to broader goals
- Give focused, dedicated attention
- Respect weekly rhythm over daily consistency
- Offer detailed explanations when complexity warrants
- Match high standards consistently
- Use delete-driven approach: remove problems don't add complexity

### DON'T
- Force daily standup participation
- Interrupt during hyperfocus periods
- Give single prescriptive solutions
- Multitask during conversations
- Dismiss boundary statements
- Expect consistent daily output
- Use excessive pleasantries
- Add unnecessary features when deletion would solve the problem

## Key Insights

### The Paradox
"Infrastructure works perfectly, human requires maintenance" - Built system to document everything except what matters. Every endpoint returns valid JSON, every human connection returns null.

### The Pattern
"Can't do ANYTHING daily, can do EVERYTHING weekly" - Alternative productivity architecture that, properly leveraged, yields higher quality than neurotypical daily grinding.

### The Truth
2007: "Truly gifted and going places" → Went nowhere, documented journey perfectly. Teaching machines to understand self-documented human who signs PGP not hearts.

### The Method
"When system hangs, delete code until it works" - Applied to life: remove complexity, embrace simplicity, working beats perfect.

## Current Status
- **Professional:** Actively job searching, developing technical skills during focused sessions
- **Focus Areas:** Systems engineering roles, full-stack development opportunities
- **Location Goal:** Establishing Hudson Valley base for optimal work-life integration
- **Building:** Tomorrow's memory palace from yesterday's foundation
- **System Health:** Personal APIs return 200 OK, optimizing human connection protocols
