## On AI and LLMs

I use AI extensively as a tool — not a replacement for human judgment, but an amplifier of investigative capacity. A two-person newsroom can now analyze datasets that would have required teams and months of work.

**What AI is good for**: Fact extraction from documents. Semantic search across thousands of records. Auto-tagging years of unorganized archives. Geolocation verification. Pattern recognition in satellite imagery. The boring parts of investigative work that machines can do faster.

**What matters**: Flipping the surveillance script. The same technologies used for control can increase transparency and accountability. Projects like OpenOversight and Amazon Mining Watch show AI identifying police officers and illegal gold mines — using power against power.

**What I'm skeptical of**: AI replicating colonial dynamics. Models trained on white, western, wealthy perspectives being unleashed on communities they weren't designed to understand. Tech that extracts value rather than building mutual aid. Hype over working software.

**How I actually use it**: Claude instances coordinating via tmux sessions in plain English. Cryptographic predictions with SHA-256 verification because accountability matters. Delete-driven development — when the system hangs, delete code until it works. Simple beats clever. Working beats perfect.

The goal is technology for joy, not just profit. AI that serves communities, not exploits them. Open source. Diverse perspectives. Verification over vibes.
