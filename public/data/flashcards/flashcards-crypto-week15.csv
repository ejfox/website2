"Why not SHA-256 for passwords?","Too fast. GPUs can try billions per second."
"What is a password hash function?","Deliberately slow hash. Memory-hard. Salted."
"bcrypt based on what cipher?","Blowfish. Expensive key schedule."
"bcrypt work factor parameter?","Cost factor (4-31). Doubles time per increment."
"bcrypt output size?","184 bits (24 bytes) hash + salt + params."
"bcrypt max password length?","72 bytes. Truncates silently."
"What is PBKDF2?","Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2. Iterated HMAC."
"PBKDF2 minimum iterations (2023)?","310,000 for SHA-256. OWASP recommendation."
"Why is PBKDF2 weaker than bcrypt?","Not memory-hard. GPU-friendly."
"scrypt unique feature?","Memory-hard. Requires large RAM to compute."
"scrypt parameters?","N (cost), r (block size), p (parallelism)."
"Argon2 variants?","Argon2d (data-dependent), Argon2i (data-independent), Argon2id (hybrid)."
"Which Argon2 for passwords?","Argon2id. Resistant to side-channels and GPU."
"Argon2 parameters?","Memory, time, parallelism."
"What is a salt?","Random value per password. Prevents rainbow tables."
"Rainbow table attack?","Precomputed hash chains. Defeated by salts."
"What is credential stuffing?","Using leaked passwords on other sites. Why unique passwords matter."
