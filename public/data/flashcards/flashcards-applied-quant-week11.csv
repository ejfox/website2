"What is on-chain data?","Data recorded directly on blockchain: transactions, wallet balances, smart contract interactions. Public and immutable. Shows actual usage, not just price speculation. Source: Glassnode, Dune Analytics, blockchain explorers."
"What are active addresses?","Count of unique addresses that were active (sent or received) in a period. Proxy for network usage/adoption. Rising active addresses with flat price = potential bullish divergence. But: one user can have many addresses."
"What is MVRV ratio?","Market Value to Realized Value. MV = current market cap. RV = sum of all coins valued at price when last moved. MVRV > 3 historically indicates overvaluation. MVRV < 1 indicates potential undervaluation."
"What is realized value/realized cap?","Sum of all coins × price when each was last moved. Represents aggregate cost basis of all holders. Less volatile than market cap. Used as 'fair value' anchor in on-chain analysis."
"What do exchange inflows/outflows indicate?","Inflows to exchanges: users depositing, possibly to sell (bearish). Outflows from exchanges: users withdrawing to hold (bullish). Large sudden flows often precede volatility."
"What is the SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio)?","Average sale price / average acquisition price for coins moved that day. SOPR > 1: sellers in profit. SOPR < 1: sellers at loss. SOPR = 1 often acts as support/resistance in bull/bear markets."
"What problems complicate on-chain metrics interpretation?","Self-transfers (inflates activity). Exchange internal transfers. Wash trading. One entity = many addresses. Change addresses. Lost coins. Need to understand data generating process, not just correlations."
"What is an event study?","Methodology to measure abnormal returns around a specific event. Compare actual returns to expected returns (from model). Abnormal Return = Actual - Expected. Aggregate over event window."
"What are the components of an event study?","(1) Estimation window: period before event to estimate 'normal' returns. (2) Event window: days around event to study. (3) Normal return model: market model or mean return. (4) CAR: Cumulative Abnormal Return."
"What is the market model for expected returns?","R_it = α + β × R_mt + ε. Regress asset returns on market returns in estimation window. Predicted return = α̂ + β̂ × R_m. Abnormal return = actual - predicted. Controls for market-wide movements."
"What is Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR)?","Sum of abnormal returns over event window. CAR[-5,+5] = sum of AR from day -5 to +5. Captures total impact of event. Test significance: CAR / SE should be ~ t-distributed."
"Why are crypto event studies challenging?","24/7 markets (no overnight gaps). High volatility makes 'normal' hard to define. Events often leak before announcement. Multiple events coincide. Thin liquidity around events. Short history for estimation."
"What is event leakage and how do you detect it?","Price moves before official announcement if info leaked. Check pre-event abnormal returns. Significant AR at t=-2, -3 suggests leakage. Extends event window or questions timing of 'event'."
"What are good event study events in crypto?","ETF decisions, exchange listings/delistings, fork announcements, regulatory actions, major hacks, protocol upgrades. Need precise date and clear before/after. Avoid events with fuzzy timing."
"What is the difference between short-term and long-term event effects?","Short-term (CAR[-1,+1]): immediate market reaction, most robust. Long-term (CAR[0,+30]): sustained impact, but confounded by other events. Focus on short windows for cleanest identification."
"What sources provide on-chain data?","Glassnode (paid + free tier): comprehensive metrics. Dune Analytics (free): custom SQL queries. CoinMetrics: institutional grade. Blockchain explorers (Etherscan): raw transaction data. Python: web3.py for direct queries."
