"What is the difference between a population and a sample?","Population = complete set you want to learn about (usually unobservable). Sample = subset you actually measure (what you work with). All statistical inference is about learning population truths from sample data."
"Why can't observational studies prove causation?","You watch but don't intervene. Observed differences between groups may be caused by the treatment OR by other differences between the groups (confounders). Only controlled experiments with random assignment can isolate causal effects."
"What is selection bias?","When your sample differs systematically from the population you care about. Examples: surveys only reaching people with phones, medical studies only including volunteers. Distorts ALL conclusions."
"What do mean and median each reveal about a distribution?","Mean = arithmetic average, affected by outliers. Median = middle value, robust to outliers. When mean >> median, distribution is right-skewed (common in income, energy demand). Use median for 'typical' value when skewed."
"What does standard deviation (SD) measure?","Average distance from the mean. Roughly 68% of data falls within 1 SD of mean for normal distributions. Large SD = high variability. SD is in same units as the data."
"What is IQR and when should you use it?","Interquartile Range = P75 - P25 (middle 50%). More robust to outliers than SD. Use when distribution is skewed or has outliers. IQR/1.35 ≈ SD for normal distributions."
"Why do grid operators plan for P99 instead of the mean?","Grid must handle peak demand, not average demand. If mean is 50 GW but P99 is 75 GW, you need 75 GW capacity. Planning for mean would cause blackouts during peaks. Distributional thinking = operational thinking."
"What does probability mean as 'long-run frequency'?","P(event) = fraction of times event occurs if you repeated the process infinitely. 30% chance of rain means: if we had many identical days, 30% would have rain. NOT a property of any single day."
"What is P95 (95th percentile)?","Value below which 95% of observations fall. Only 5% of observations exceed P95. Critical for capacity planning, VaR calculations, stress testing. P95 of summer demand tells you what capacity rarely gets exceeded."
"How do you check if data is normally distributed?","Q-Q plot: plot sample quantiles vs theoretical normal quantiles. Straight line = normal. Curved = non-normal. Also: histogram shape, compare skewness/kurtosis to 0/3. Financial returns and peak demand are usually NOT normal."
"What is the formula for required capacity given forecast and reliability target?","capacity = forecast + z * SD, where z = qnorm(reliability). For 99% reliability, z ≈ 2.33. So if forecast = 72 GW with SD = 3 GW, need 72 + 2.33*3 = 79 GW to ensure P(demand > capacity) < 1%."
"What's the difference between a histogram and a density plot?","Histogram: bars showing count/frequency in bins. Depends on bin width choice. Density plot: smoothed continuous estimate of probability distribution. Area under curve = 1. Density allows easier comparison across different sample sizes."
"What makes an experiment 'controlled'?","Random assignment to treatment/control groups. Randomization ensures only CHANCE differences between groups at baseline. Any outcome differences can be attributed to treatment. Observational studies lack this."
"Why should you always plot data before calculating statistics?","Anscombe's quartet: very different datasets can have identical mean, SD, correlation, regression line. Plots reveal outliers, non-linearity, clusters, data quality issues that summary stats hide."
"What is conditional probability and why does it matter?","P(A|B) = probability of A given B already occurred. Changes your inference based on new information. P(high demand | heat wave) >> P(high demand). Foundation of Bayesian updating."
"How do you calculate the z-score (standard units)?","z = (x - mean) / SD. Tells you how many SDs a value is from the mean. z=2 means 2 SDs above average. Allows comparison across different scales. In normal dist, |z|>2 is unusual (~5%)."
