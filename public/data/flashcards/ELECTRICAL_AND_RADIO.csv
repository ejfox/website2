What is windshear?,Sudden change in wind speed/direction,"Can flip drone, very dangerous"
What causes turbulence?,"Wind over obstacles, thermals, weather fronts, rotor from mountains",Gusty winds = turbulence risk
What is convective activity?,"Rising air from surface heating (thermals, thunderstorms)","Unstable air, turbulence, can carry light drones"
When are thermals strongest?,"Afternoon, hot days, dark surfaces (pavement, plowed fields)",Morning = calmer typically
Thunderstorm hazards for drones?,"Extreme turbulence, hail, lightning, microbursts, heavy rain",Don't fly near or under thunderstorms. Ever.
What is ICING?,Moisture freezing on aircraft,Rare for low-altitude drones but can affect props/motors in winter
Daylight operations definition?,30 minutes before sunrise to 30 minutes after sunset,Civil twilight. Extended with anti-collision lights now.
Anti-collision light requirement?,"Visible 3 statute miles, if flying twilight/night","Flashing or steady, meets requirement"
Can you waive Part 107 rules?,YES - some rules can be waived with FAA approval,"VLOS, operations over people, from moving vehicle - can request waiver"
How to request waiver?,FAA DroneZone online portal,Requires detailed safety case
Commercial vs recreational difference?,Commercial = compensation/business. Recreational = hobby only.,Recreational falls under Exception for Recreational Flyers
Recreational rules (non-107)?,"Must follow CBO guidelines, recreational only, <55 lbs, register if >0.55 lbs",No test required for recreational
What is a CBO?,Community Based Organization (like AMA - Academy of Model Aeronautics),Recreational flyers must follow CBO safety guidelines
Can you share footage from recreational flight?,YES - but can't be PAID for it,"YouTube ad revenue = gray area, direct payment = commercial"
Does Part 107 cover government drones?,"NO - public aircraft (police, fire, govt) have separate rules",Part 107 is for civil (commercial/private) operations
Part 107 altitude (400ft AGL) vs ham antenna height?,"Both measured AGL (above ground level), not MSL",Ham: higher = better. Drone: 400ft max.
VLOS requirement is like?,Visual line of sight = must see with unaided eye (like ham radio horizon),Can't operate beyond visual range (like VHF line-of-sight)
TFR is like ham radio forbidden frequencies?,Absolute prohibition - wildfire TFR = no ops (like restricted spectrum),Check NOTAMs like checking band plan
LAANC authorization is like?,Automated approval system (like LAANC instant approval vs weeks for manual),Like API vs manual request process
Sectional chart is like network diagram?,"Visual map of airspace classes, airports, hazards","Like topology map showing routers, subnets, firewalls"
Airspace classes (B/C/D/E/G) are like?,Security zones or permission levels,"Class B = most restricted, Class G = uncontrolled"
"Weather minimums (3 SM, cloud clearance) are like?",Minimum viable conditions for operation,"Below minimums = unsafe, don't fly"
Density altitude effect on drone performance?,Hot/high/humid = reduced lift (same as aircraft performance),"Thin air = less thrust, shorter flight time"
METAR wind notation (27015G25KT) is like?,Structured data format (270° at 15kt gusting 25kt),"Parse like log files: direction, speed, gusts"
Preflight inspection is like?,"Pre-deployment checklist (battery, props, links, GPS)",Catch failures before they happen in production
Return-to-home (RTH) is like?,Failsafe or exception handler (signal loss → RTH),Default safe behavior on error condition
Geofencing is like?,Software-enforced boundaries (can't fly in restricted areas),Like firewall rules or access control
Registration requirement (<55 lbs) is like?,Device registration or MAC address tracking,Unique ID for accountability
Accident reporting threshold is like?,Incident response protocol (>$500 damage or hospitalization),Mandatory reporting for serious events
PIC responsibility is like?,Root user or admin - ultimately responsible for all actions,Can delegate control but not responsibility
LiPo battery fire risk is like?,Runaway process or thermal throttling risk,Damaged battery = catastrophic failure (fire/explosion)
Propeller wash hazard is like?,Exhaust blast or output overflow,40+ mph downward airflow can injure bystanders
Flyaway (lost control) is like?,Process escaping control or runaway thread,Set RTH as failsafe to recover
VO (Visual Observer) is like?,Secondary monitoring or redundancy,"Backup eyes, communicates with PIC"
Right-of-way (manned aircraft) is like?,Priority queue or interrupt handling,"Manned aircraft = highest priority, always yield"
CRM (Crew Resource Management) is like?,Team communication protocols or agile standup,"Speak up if you see safety issue, regardless of hierarchy"
"Stadium TFR (1nm, 3000ft, ±1hr) is like?",Temporary resource lock during high-traffic event,Exclusive airspace during game (like DB lock during transaction)
Wildfire TFR is absolute like?,"Critical system failure - no exceptions, immediate cessation","'If you fly, we can't' - grounds firefighting aircraft"
NOTAM checking is like?,Polling for system status before operation,Check before EVERY flight (like health check before deployment)
Daylight ops (30 min before sunrise to after sunset) is like?,Operating hours or scheduled maintenance window,Extended with anti-collision lights (like extended support hours)
Waiver process is like?,Exception request or policy override,Request approval for operations outside standard rules
Commercial vs recreational is like?,Production vs dev environment,"Recreational = hobby, commercial = business (requires cert)"
