"RSA key generation step 1?","Generate large primes p, q (~1024-2048 bits each)."
"RSA key generation step 2?","Compute n = p × q."
"RSA key generation step 3?","Compute φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)."
"RSA key generation step 4?","Choose e coprime to φ(n). Common: e = 65537 = 2¹⁶ + 1."
"RSA key generation step 5?","Compute d = e⁻¹ mod φ(n)."
"RSA public key?","(n, e)."
"RSA private key?","(n, d) or (p, q, d)."
"RSA encryption?","c = m^e mod n."
"RSA decryption?","m = c^d mod n."
"RSA signing?","s = m^d mod n."
"RSA verification?","m = s^e mod n."
"Why does RSA work mathematically?","Euler's theorem: m^(ed) ≡ m (mod n) when ed ≡ 1 mod φ(n)."
"Why is textbook RSA insecure?","Deterministic. Small messages vulnerable. Use OAEP padding."
"What padding for RSA encryption?","OAEP. Adds randomness."
"What padding for RSA signatures?","PSS."
"What attack exploits PKCS#1 v1.5?","Bleichenbacher attack. Padding validation must be constant-time."
