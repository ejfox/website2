"DH public parameters?","Prime p, generator g."
"DH: Alice sends?","A = g^a mod p."
"DH: Bob sends?","B = g^b mod p."
"DH shared secret?","K = g^(ab) mod p. Both compute this."
"What does eavesdropper see in DH?","g, p, g^a, g^b. Not enough to compute g^ab."
"DH vulnerability?","Man-in-the-middle. No authentication."
"What is CDH problem?","Computational DH: Given g^a, g^b, compute g^(ab)."
"What is DDH problem?","Decisional DH: Distinguish (g^a, g^b, g^ab) from (g^a, g^b, g^c)."
"ElGamal public key?","(g, p, h = g^x mod p). x is private."
"ElGamal ciphertext?","(c₁, c₂) = (g^k, m · h^k). k is random."
"Year of DH paper?","1976. 'New Directions in Cryptography'."
"What is a safe prime?","p where (p-1)/2 is also prime. Simplifies secure parameters."
