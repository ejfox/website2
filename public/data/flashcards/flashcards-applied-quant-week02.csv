"What does the correlation coefficient (r) measure?","Strength and direction of LINEAR relationship between two variables. Ranges from -1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive). r=0 means no linear relationship (but could still have non-linear pattern!)."
"Why is r² often more useful than r?","r² = fraction of variance in Y explained by X. If r=0.7, r²=0.49, meaning X explains 49% of Y's variation. More interpretable: 'half the variation explained' vs 'correlation of 0.7'."
"What is spurious correlation?","Two variables correlate not because one causes the other, but because both are driven by a third factor OR both trend over time. Example: ice cream sales and drownings both correlate because both increase in summer."
"Why do two trending time series show high correlation even if unrelated?","Both going up → values tend to be high together early and late. r captures co-movement, not causation. Solution: correlate the CHANGES (first differences), not the levels."
"What are first differences and why use them?","Δx_t = x_t - x_{t-1} (change from previous period). Removes trend. Two unrelated random walks may correlate in levels but not in first differences. Always de-trend before testing relationships."
"What's the danger of subsetting data before calculating correlation?","Correlation can differ dramatically by subset. Demand vs temp might be r=0.3 overall but r=0.8 for days >80°F and r=-0.5 for days <50°F. The U-shaped relationship disappears in aggregate r."
"What is Simpson's Paradox?","A trend that appears in different groups of data disappears or reverses when groups are combined. Example: treatment appears harmful overall but helpful in each subgroup. Aggregation can lie."
"What does 'always plot before calculating' mean for correlation?","Same r can come from very different relationships: linear, curved, clustered, one outlier driving everything. Anscombe's quartet proves this. Scatterplot reveals truth that r hides."
"How can a single outlier distort correlation?","One extreme point can pull r dramatically toward 1 or -1. With n=20 data points near r=0, one outlier can create r=0.9. Always check scatterplot for influential observations."
"What is the ecological fallacy related to correlation?","Correlation at group level may not hold at individual level. States with higher gun ownership have higher homicide (correlation). Doesn't mean individual gun owners are more likely to commit homicide."
"What's the difference between correlation and regression?","Correlation: symmetric (r of X,Y = r of Y,X), unitless, just measures association. Regression: asymmetric (Y depends on X), has units, allows prediction, estimates slope and intercept."
"In energy analysis, why is temperature-demand correlation often nonlinear?","Demand is U-shaped with temperature: high demand when cold (heating) AND when hot (cooling). Linear correlation misses this. Need to model the curve or split by season."
