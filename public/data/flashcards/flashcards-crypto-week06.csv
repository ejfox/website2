"Why is ECB mode broken?","Identical plaintext blocks → identical ciphertext blocks. Patterns leak."
"ECB formula?","Cᵢ = E(K, Pᵢ). No chaining."
"CBC formula?","Cᵢ = E(K, Pᵢ ⊕ Cᵢ₋₁). C₀ = IV."
"CTR formula?","Cᵢ = Pᵢ ⊕ E(K, Nonce || Counter). Turns block cipher into stream cipher."
"What attack does CBC enable?","Padding oracle attack. Different errors for 'invalid padding' vs 'invalid MAC'."
"What happens with CTR nonce reuse?","Two-time pad. XOR ciphertexts = XOR plaintexts."
"What is GCM?","Galois/Counter Mode. CTR encryption + GHASH authentication. AEAD."
"What is PKCS#7 padding?","Add n bytes of value n to reach block boundary."
"Which modes are parallelizable for encryption?","ECB and CTR. CBC is sequential."
"Which mode is current best practice?","GCM (Galois/Counter Mode). Provides AEAD."
"What does the 'ECB penguin' demonstrate?","Visual pattern preservation. Encrypt image in ECB, patterns visible."
"What document specifies block cipher modes?","NIST SP 800-38A."
