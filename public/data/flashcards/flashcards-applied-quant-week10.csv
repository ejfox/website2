"What is backtesting?","Testing a trading strategy on historical data to see how it would have performed. Simulates trades you would have made if you'd followed the strategy in the past. Foundation of quantitative trading."
"What is the fundamental problem of backtesting?","You already know what happened. Easy to find patterns that 'worked' historically but were just noise. Overfitting to past data means strategy fails on new data. The future won't match the past exactly."
"What is overfitting in trading strategies?","Strategy captures noise (random patterns) rather than signal (true predictability). Signs: amazing backtest, poor live performance. Too many parameters, too many rules, tuned to specific historical events."
"What is data snooping (p-hacking in trading)?","Testing many strategies or parameters and reporting only the best. Try 100 random strategies, one will look great by chance. Must adjust for multiple testing or use strict out-of-sample validation."
"What is in-sample vs out-of-sample testing?","In-sample: data used to develop/tune strategy. Out-of-sample: data held back, never seen during development. True test is out-of-sample. Decide the split BEFORE looking at any data."
"What is walk-forward validation?","(1) Train on window 1. (2) Test on next period. (3) Roll forward, retrain. (4) Repeat. Mimics real trading where you retrain periodically. More realistic than single train/test split."
"What is the Sharpe ratio?","(Mean return - Risk-free rate) / SD of returns. Measures risk-adjusted return. Sharpe = 1 is good, Sharpe = 2 is excellent. Annualize: daily Sharpe × √252. Most reported Sharpes are overstated due to data snooping."
"What is maximum drawdown?","Largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value. If portfolio went from $100 to $60, max drawdown = -40%. Measures worst-case pain. Strategy might have great Sharpe but intolerable drawdowns."
"What is survivorship bias in backtesting?","Only testing on assets that still exist. Stocks that went bankrupt are excluded from databases. Makes historical returns look better than they were. Crypto: only testing on coins that survived."
"What is look-ahead bias?","Using information in backtest that wouldn't have been available at the time. Example: using revised GDP instead of first release. Or using full-day data to make decisions at market open."
"What is the Deflated Sharpe Ratio?","Sharpe ratio adjusted for multiple testing. If you tried N strategies, the expected best Sharpe by chance is high. Bailey & López de Prado: deflate by number of trials. Most 'discoveries' disappear."
"Why do most published strategies fail to replicate?","Data snooping in development. Publication bias (failures not published). Market adaptation (others trade on it). Transaction costs ignored. Regimes change. Estimated Sharpes are systematically inflated."
"What transaction costs should backtests include?","Bid-ask spread, commissions, slippage (market impact), funding costs. Ignored costs = overstated returns. Rule of thumb: realistic costs can halve strategy returns. Crypto: include exchange fees + withdrawal costs."
"What is a benchmark in strategy evaluation?","Comparison point for strategy performance. Simplest: buy-and-hold. Also: market index return. Strategy must beat benchmark to be valuable. 'I made 20%' means nothing if BTC rose 100%."
"What questions should you ask about any backtest?","(1) What's the out-of-sample period? (2) How many strategies were tried? (3) Are transaction costs realistic? (4) Is there survivorship/look-ahead bias? (5) Would you actually trade this?"
