"Why include multiple predictors in regression?","(1) Control for confounders to isolate effect of interest. (2) Improve prediction by using more information. (3) Reduce residual variance, making estimates more precise. But be careful—wrong controls can introduce bias."
"What is a confounder?","Variable that affects BOTH the treatment/exposure AND the outcome. Creates spurious association. Example: income affects both renewable adoption AND electricity consumption. Must control for confounders to estimate causal effect."
"What is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)?","Visual representation of causal assumptions. Arrows show causal direction (X → Y means X causes Y). 'Acyclic' = no feedback loops. Forces you to state assumptions explicitly. Use to determine what to control for."
"What are the three types of paths in a DAG?","(1) Causal/direct: X → Y. (2) Backdoor: X ← Z → Y (Z is confounder). (3) Collider: X → Z ← Y. Confounders open backdoor paths (bias). Colliders block paths but controlling for them OPENS bias."
"What is a collider and why is controlling for it dangerous?","A collider is caused by two variables: X → Z ← Y. Controlling for Z creates spurious association between X and Y even if none exists. Example: controlling for 'hospitalized' creates correlation between unrelated diseases."
"What does 'holding constant' really mean in multiple regression?","Each coefficient estimates the partial effect of that variable, as if other variables didn't change. It's a statistical adjustment, not literal experimental control. Assumes correct functional form and no omitted confounders."
"How does a coefficient change when you add controls?","If control was a confounder: coefficient moves toward causal effect. If control was collider: coefficient becomes biased. If control was irrelevant: coefficient barely changes, SE might decrease slightly."
"What is omitted variable bias?","When a confounder is left out of regression, its effect gets absorbed into other coefficients. Direction of bias depends on confounder's correlation with treatment and outcome. No controls = biased if confounders exist."
"What is the backdoor criterion in DAGs?","To identify causal effect of X on Y: block all 'backdoor' paths from Y to X (paths with arrows pointing into X). Do this by controlling for variables that close backdoor paths, but NOT colliders."
"When does controlling for a variable make things WORSE?","(1) Controlling for collider opens bias. (2) Controlling for mediator removes part of true effect. (3) Controlling for 'bad control' affected by treatment. DAG helps identify these cases."
"What is a mediator?","Variable on the causal path: X → M → Y. Controlling for M removes the indirect effect of X through M. Usually don't control for mediators if you want total effect. Only control if you want direct effect."
"What is selection on observables?","Assumption that, conditional on observed controls, treatment is as-good-as-random. Allows causal interpretation if you control for ALL confounders. Very strong assumption—can never prove you got everything."
"What's the difference between predictive and causal regression?","Predictive: maximize R², include whatever helps prediction, interpretation of coefficients not important. Causal: carefully select controls based on DAG, coefficient interpretation is the goal, wrong controls can bias."
"What does multicollinearity do to regression?","When predictors are highly correlated, hard to separate their individual effects. Coefficients become unstable (high SE). R² stays fine but individual coefficients are unreliable. Solution: combine variables or drop one."
