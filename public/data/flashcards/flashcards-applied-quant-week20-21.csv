"What makes a research question 'good' for a capstone?","Answerable with available data. Requires methods from at least two domains. Has a clear answer (not just 'it depends'). Interesting to you. Can be completed in two weeks."
"What is a reproducible code repository?","All code, data (or links), and documentation needed to replicate analysis. README explains how to run. Uses relative paths. Environment documented (R/Python versions). Anyone can reproduce your results."
"What is literate programming?","Code interspersed with explanation (R Markdown, Jupyter). Reader sees analysis logic, not just output. Self-documenting. Capstone write-up should include code or link to repo."
"How do you scope a two-week project?","Week 1: data acquisition, cleaning, exploratory analysis, initial models. Week 2: refinement, robustness checks, write-up, visualization. Build in buffer. Simpler is better than unfinished."
"What is a 'minimum viable analysis'?","Simplest version that answers your question. Start here, then add complexity. Better to have complete simple analysis than incomplete complex one. Can always extend later."
"What should a capstone write-up include?","Introduction (question, why it matters). Data (sources, cleaning). Methods (what you did, why). Results (findings, visualizations). Discussion (interpretation, limitations). Conclusion (answer, next steps)."
"How many figures should a capstone have?","Quality over quantity. 4-6 publication-quality figures. Each should make one clear point. Caption should be standalone. Show uncertainty. Avoid chartjunk."
"What is a robustness check?","Testing if results hold under different assumptions. Alternative specifications, different samples, different methods. If results only appear with one specific choice, be skeptical."
"How do you handle a null result?","A null result is still a result. 'No relationship found' is informative IF you had power to detect one. Discuss: was this expected? What would change your conclusion? Honest nulls are valuable."
"What is 'honest punting' in research?","Acknowledging you can't answer the question with available data/methods. Better to say 'I can't tell' than to overclaim. Identifies what would be needed to answer properly."
"How do you write for non-technical readers?","Lead with findings, not methods. Use analogies. Show, don't tell (visualizations). Define jargon. Short sentences. State uncertainty in plain language. Technical details in appendix."
"What is a limitation worth stating?","Anything that could change your conclusions. Data quality issues. Assumptions that might not hold. Things you didn't control for. Alternative explanations. Threats to validity."
"What is the final self-assessment question?","Did I learn what I set out to learn? Can I apply these methods independently? Where am I still weak? What would I do differently? Track progress against Phase checkpoints."
"What comes after completing the curriculum?","Apply methods to real work. Publish forecasts and evaluate. Read primary sources in each domain. Teach others (best way to learn). Build portfolio of analyses."
"What is the core lesson of three-domain learning?","Methods are universal; applications vary. Fast feedback (finance) builds intuition. Slow feedback (energy) demands rigor. Medium feedback (elections) tests communication. All require humility about uncertainty."
