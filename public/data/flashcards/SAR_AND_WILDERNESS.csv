Bowline - when to use?,"Fixed loop. Rescue, antenna support, guy lines",Won't slip or jam under load
Clove hitch - when to use?,Quick temporary pole attachment,Can slip under varying load or with slippery rope
Trucker's hitch advantage?,3:1 mechanical advantage (rope-only pulley),For tensioning guy lines
Working end vs standing end?,Working = free end you tie. Standing = fixed end,"Working manipulates, standing is anchor"
Figure-8 knot purpose?,Stopper knot (prevents rope through hole),"Simple, strong, easy to inspect"
Square knot danger?,Can capsize under load - NOT for critical use,"Only for same-diameter ropes, low load"
Sheet bend - when to use?,Join ropes of DIFFERENT diameters,More secure than square knot
Guy line - why 3+ points?,Triangulation provides lateral stability,"3 minimum, 4+ better for tall masts"
Working Load Limit (WLL)?,10-20% of break strength,Safety margin - never exceed
Sheet bend (different diameter ropes) is like?,Type coercion or adapter pattern,Connects incompatible types safely
Trucker's hitch (3:1 mechanical advantage) is like?,Leverage or force multiplication algorithm,Input force × 3 = output tension
AVPU,"Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unresponsive - scale for consciousness level"
ABCDE,"Airway: Make sure the mouth, nose, throat, and upper airway are clear of obstructions so the patient can breathe.
Breathing: Look, listen, and feel for breathing. Are they breathing? Is the breathing labored, easy, deep, shallow, etc.?
Circulation: Check for a pulse and look for signs of severe bleeding.
Disability: Making a decision if spine protection is needed (if you didn’t observe the incident, assume disability).
Expose: Examine your patient for obvious, major injuries, and if needed control bleeding."
