"Three hash function security properties?","Preimage resistance, second preimage resistance, collision resistance."
"What is preimage resistance?","Given h, hard to find m where H(m) = h."
"What is collision resistance?","Hard to find any m₁ ≠ m₂ where H(m₁) = H(m₂)."
"Birthday paradox implication for hashes?","Finding collisions needs ~2^(n/2) work. SHA-256 has 128-bit collision resistance."
"MD5 output size?","128 bits. Broken—practical collisions exist."
"SHA-1 output size?","160 bits. Broken—SHAttered demonstrated collisions."
"SHA-256 output size?","256 bits. Secure. Current standard."
"Why not use H(K || m) for authentication?","Length extension attack. Knowing H(K||m) allows computing H(K||m||padding||m')."
"What construction does HMAC use?","H((K ⊕ opad) || H((K ⊕ ipad) || m))."
"Which hashes are vulnerable to length extension?","Merkle-Damgård: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256."
"Which hash resists length extension?","SHA-3 (Keccak). Uses sponge construction."
"What RFC specifies HMAC?","RFC 2104."
