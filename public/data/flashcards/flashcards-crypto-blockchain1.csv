"Bitcoin hash function?","SHA-256d (double SHA-256)."
"Ethereum hash function?","Keccak-256 (not standard SHA-3)."
"What is a Merkle tree?","Binary tree of hashes. Root commits to all leaves."
"Merkle proof size?","O(log n). Proves leaf inclusion efficiently."
"Bitcoin address derived how?","SHA-256 → RIPEMD-160 → Base58Check."
"What curve does Bitcoin use?","secp256k1. 256-bit Koblitz curve."
"What curve does Ethereum use?","secp256k1. Same as Bitcoin."
"What is ECDSA r-value reuse?","Reveals private key. Happened to Sony PS3, Android Bitcoin."
"Bitcoin block header size?","80 bytes. Contains: version, prev hash, merkle root, time, bits, nonce."
"What is difficulty target?","Hash must be below target. Adjusted every 2016 blocks."
"Proof of Work security assumption?","Honest miners control >50% hashpower."
"What is selfish mining?","Withhold blocks to gain advantage. Works at <50%."
"What is a 51% attack?","Majority hashpower rewrites history. Double-spend."
"PoS 'nothing at stake' problem?","Validators can vote on all forks. No cost."
"What is slashing?","Penalizing validators for misbehavior. Burns stake."
"Ethereum PoS finality time?","~15 minutes (2 epochs)."
