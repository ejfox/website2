"DES block size?","64 bits."
"DES key size?","56 bits. Why it's broken."
"3DES key size?","112 or 168 bits."
"AES block size?","128 bits."
"AES key sizes?","128, 192, or 256 bits."
"DES rounds?","16 rounds."
"AES-128 rounds?","10 rounds."
"AES-256 rounds?","14 rounds."
"What is a Feistel network?","Self-inverting structure: split block, R' = L ⊕ F(R,key), L' = R. DES uses this."
"What is a Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN)?","Alternating S-boxes (substitution) and P-boxes (permutation). AES uses this."
"AES round operations?","SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey."
"What provides confusion in block ciphers?","S-boxes. Each ciphertext bit depends on many key bits."
"What provides diffusion in block ciphers?","Permutations. Each plaintext bit affects many ciphertext bits."
"Why is DES key schedule weak?","Enables related-key attacks. Good key schedules resist this."
