"What is Fermat's Little Theorem?","a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p) for prime p, when gcd(a,p)=1."
"What is Euler's Theorem?","a^φ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n) for gcd(a,n)=1. Generalizes Fermat."
"What is the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP)?","Given g, h, n: find x where g^x ≡ h (mod n)."
"What two hardness assumptions does cryptography rely on?","Integer Factorization (RSA) and Discrete Logarithm (DH, ElGamal, DSA, ECC)."
"Are factoring and DLP proven hard?","No. Believed hard but not proven. Cryptography rests on computational assumptions."
"What algorithm tests if a number is prime?","Miller-Rabin (probabilistic primality test)."
"What is a safe prime?","Prime p where (p-1)/2 is also prime."
"What would P = NP mean for cryptography?","Many cryptosystems broken. Factoring and DLP would be easy."
"What is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic?","Every integer has unique prime factorization."
"What are quadratic residues?","Numbers that are perfect squares mod n. Used in advanced protocols."
