"Why use returns instead of prices for analysis?","Prices are non-stationary (trend up/down). Returns are approximately stationary (fluctuate around zero). Statistical methods require stationarity. Also: returns are scale-free and easier to compare across assets."
"What is a log return and why use it?","r_t = log(P_t / P_{t-1}) = log(P_t) - log(P_{t-1}). Log returns are additive over time (weekly = sum of daily). Symmetric: +50% and -50% returns are equal magnitude. Approximates simple returns for small values."
"What is stationarity in time series?","Statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation) don't change over time. Stationary series fluctuate around constant mean. Prices are non-stationary; returns are approximately stationary. Required for most forecasting methods."
"What are the 'stylized facts' of financial returns?","(1) Returns have fat tails (extreme events more common than normal). (2) Volatility clusters (high vol follows high vol). (3) Returns have weak autocorrelation. (4) Squared returns have strong autocorrelation. Universal across assets."
"What are fat tails in financial returns?","Extreme returns occur more often than normal distribution predicts. BTC might have 10% daily drops several times per year; normal with same SD would predict once per decade. Use Student-t or other fat-tailed distributions."
"What is volatility clustering?","Calm periods tend to follow calm periods; turbulent periods follow turbulent. High absolute returns predict high absolute returns tomorrow. Autocorrelation of |returns| or returns² is positive. Captured by GARCH models."
"How do you measure volatility?","Simple: standard deviation of returns over window (e.g., 30 days). Realized volatility: sum of squared intraday returns. GARCH: model-based conditional volatility. Report as annualized: daily SD × √252."
"What is the difference between historical and implied volatility?","Historical (realized): calculated from past returns. Implied: extracted from option prices, reflects market's forward-looking expectation. Implied - realized = volatility risk premium (usually positive)."
"Why do crypto returns differ from traditional finance?","Higher volatility (~60-80% annualized vs ~15% for stocks). Fatter tails. 24/7 trading (no overnight gaps). More regime changes. Less mean reversion. More retail-driven. Same stylized facts but more extreme."
"What is autocorrelation in returns?","Correlation of returns with their own lagged values. Returns show weak autocorrelation (~0). But |returns| and returns² show strong positive autocorrelation (volatility clustering). ACF plot shows this pattern."
"What is a unit root and why does it matter?","A series with unit root is non-stationary—shocks have permanent effects. Prices have unit root; returns don't. Regressing one unit-root series on another gives spurious results. Test with Augmented Dickey-Fuller."
"What is Value at Risk (VaR)?","Maximum expected loss over period at given confidence level. 95% daily VaR = 5th percentile of return distribution. If VaR = -3%, expect losses > 3% only 5% of days. Used for risk management."
"How do you annualize volatility?","Daily SD × √252 (trading days) or × √365 (calendar days for crypto). Weekly SD × √52. Assumes returns are independent (roughly true). Annualized makes different frequencies comparable."
"What is the leverage effect in equity returns?","Negative returns increase volatility more than positive returns of same magnitude. Price drops → higher debt/equity ratio → more risk. More pronounced in stocks than crypto. Captured by asymmetric GARCH (EGARCH, GJR)."
