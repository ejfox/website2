"What is NetCDF and why is it used for climate data?","Network Common Data Form: standard format for gridded data (lat, lon, time). Efficiently stores massive arrays with metadata. Used by IPCC, ERA5, CMIP models. Read with xarray (Python) or ncdf4 (R)."
"What is ERA5?","ECMWF Reanalysis v5: historical weather data combining observations with models. Hourly, ~30km resolution, 1940-present. Best observational climate dataset. Used for historical temperature-demand relationships."
"What are RCP/SSP scenarios?","Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) / Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP): scenarios for future emissions and socioeconomics. SSP1-1.9 = very low emissions. SSP5-8.5 = very high emissions. Not predictions—'what ifs'."
"Why did Hausfather & Peters criticize RCP8.5?","RCP8.5 was treated as 'business as usual' but requires implausible coal growth. Better to use SSP2-4.5 as reference scenario. RCP8.5 is useful for stress testing, not as baseline projection."
"What is CMIP6?","Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6: ~50 climate models from different groups. Each runs scenarios. Model spread shows structural uncertainty. Use multi-model ensemble for robust projections."
"What is climate econometrics?","Using econometric methods to estimate climate impacts from observed data. Regression of outcomes (mortality, crop yields, demand) on weather variation. Then project using climate model output."
"What are the steps in a climate impact projection?","(1) Estimate empirical model: Y ~ f(weather) from historical data. (2) Get climate projections from CMIP models. (3) Apply empirical model to projected climate. (4) Quantify uncertainty from both steps."
"What are the sources of uncertainty in climate impact projections?","(1) Model uncertainty: regression coefficient SEs. (2) Scenario uncertainty: which SSP? (3) Climate model uncertainty: which CMIP model? (4) Natural variability: weather noise. All should be reported."
"How do you extract point data from gridded climate data?","Identify lat/lon of interest. Use xarray.sel() to extract nearest grid cell or interpolate. Watch for: land/ocean masks, grid cell size (may average over large area), time zone issues."
"What is a damage function in climate economics?","Function mapping climate variables to economic outcomes. Linear: damages ∝ warming. Quadratic: damages ∝ warming². Often estimated empirically from cross-sectional or panel data. Key for cost-benefit analysis."
"What's the difference between weather and climate in impact analysis?","Weather = short-term variation (daily, yearly). Climate = long-term average. Empirical models use weather variation for identification. Applying to climate change assumes relationship is same at higher temps (extrapolation!)."
"What is the IPCC AR6 SPM?","IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Summary for Policymakers: 40-page distillation of climate science. Headline statements about observed and projected changes. Must-read for policy relevance."
"What is population-weighted climate data?","Average weather across an area, weighted by where people live. Better for demand analysis than simple grid average. Houston's temperature matters more than empty desert for Texas electricity demand."
"What's the challenge of projecting impacts far into the future?","(1) Extrapolation beyond observed data. (2) Adaptation will change relationships. (3) Technology and behavior change. (4) Compounding uncertainties. Be humble about 2100 projections—report wide ranges."
