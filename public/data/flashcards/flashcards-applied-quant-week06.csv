"What is Difference-in-Differences (DiD)?","Compare change in outcome for treated group vs change for control group. Effect = (Treated_after - Treated_before) - (Control_after - Control_before). Uses control group's change as counterfactual for what would have happened to treated."
"What is the parallel trends assumption?","Without treatment, treated and control groups would have changed similarly over time. Groups don't need to be identical—just need to follow parallel trajectories. THE key identifying assumption for DiD."
"How do you test parallel trends?","Plot pre-treatment trends for both groups—should be parallel. More formally: event study showing pre-treatment coefficients should be near zero. But can never prove parallel trends would have continued."
"What is two-way fixed effects (TWFE)?","Regression with unit fixed effects AND time fixed effects: Y_it = α_i + λ_t + β*Treated_it + ε. Unit FE absorb permanent unit differences. Time FE absorb common shocks. β is DiD estimate."
"What's the formula for a basic 2x2 DiD?","β = (Ȳ_treat,post - Ȳ_treat,pre) - (Ȳ_control,post - Ȳ_control,pre). First difference removes time-invariant unit confounders. Second difference removes common time trends."
"What is staggered treatment adoption?","When different units get treated at different times (common in policy rollouts). Traditional TWFE can give wrong answers because it uses already-treated units as controls. Need newer methods."
"What is the Goodman-Bacon decomposition?","Shows TWFE estimate is weighted average of many 2x2 DiDs, including 'forbidden' comparisons of late-treated vs already-treated. Negative weights can occur, making estimates wrong or opposite sign."
"What are the new DiD estimators for staggered adoption?","Callaway-Sant'Anna, Sun-Abraham, de Chaisemartin-D'Haultfoeuille. Each handles staggered treatment properly by never using already-treated units as controls. Use these in R package 'did' or 'fixest'."
"What is an event study in DiD context?","Estimate separate treatment effects for each period relative to treatment. Coefficients show: pre-treatment (should be ~0 if parallel trends hold), impact period, and post-treatment dynamics."
"How do you interpret an event study plot?","X-axis: time relative to treatment (t=-2,-1,0,1,2...). Y-axis: coefficient estimate with CI. Pre-treatment coefficients near zero = parallel trends OK. Post-treatment coefficients = treatment effect over time."
"What is anticipation in DiD?","Effects before treatment actually starts (at t=-1, -2). Could mean: treatment was anticipated, timing is measured wrong, or trends weren't parallel. Undermines causal interpretation."
"What threats exist to DiD identification?","(1) Non-parallel trends. (2) Spillovers to control group. (3) Composition changes (units enter/exit sample). (4) Concurrent policies affecting only treated. (5) Anticipation effects."
"What is RGGI and why is it a good DiD example?","Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative: cap-and-trade for power sector. States joined at different times starting 2009. Natural experiment: compare emissions in RGGI vs non-RGGI states over time."
"What are clustered standard errors and when to use them?","When errors are correlated within groups (e.g., same state over time). DiD ALWAYS needs clustering at treatment level (usually state). Ignoring clustering makes SEs too small and p-values too small."
