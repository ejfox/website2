"What was Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160)?","OpenSSL buffer over-read. Server leaked 64KB memory per request."
"Heartbleed affected which TLS extension?","Heartbeat extension. Missing bounds check."
"Debian OpenSSL bug (2008) caused what?","Only 32,768 possible keys. PID was only entropy source."
"How long did Debian OpenSSL bug persist?","2 years (2006-2008). All keys generated in that period compromised."
"PS3 ECDSA fail: root cause?","Sony used fixed k value. Private key recoverable from two signatures."
"ECDSA: why must k be random?","Same k on different messages reveals private key algebraically."
"What is a padding oracle attack?","Server reveals if padding valid. Decrypt ciphertext byte-by-byte."
"POODLE attack exploited what?","SSLv3 CBC padding. Padding bytes not authenticated."
"Lucky 13 attack type?","Timing attack on CBC MAC-then-encrypt. Leaked plaintext."
"What is a timing side-channel?","Execution time reveals secret data. Must use constant-time code."
"Bleichenbacher attack target?","PKCS#1 v1.5 RSA encryption. Million-message attack."
"ROBOT (2017) showed what?","Bleichenbacher attack still worked 19 years later on major sites."
"BEAST attack exploited what?","CBC IV predictability in TLS 1.0. Fixed in TLS 1.1+."
"CRIME attack targeted what?","TLS compression. Compression ratio leaked secrets."
"What is a nonce-reuse attack?","Same nonce with same key breaks AEAD. Catastrophic for GCM."
