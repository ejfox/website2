"What is a fundamentals model for elections?","Predict election outcome from structural factors: economy, presidential approval, incumbency, time in power. No polls needed. Provides baseline forecast months before election."
"What is the 'Time for Change' model?","Abramowitz model: Vote_share = f(GDP growth, approval rating, time-for-change penalty). Incumbent party loses after two terms. Simple model, historically accurate. Uses Q2 GDP growth."
"What economic variables predict elections?","GDP growth (especially recent), unemployment change, real income growth, consumer sentiment. Voters respond to conditions in election year, especially last 6 months. 'Pocketbook voting.'"
"What is the midterm penalty?","President's party almost always loses House seats in midterms. Average loss ~25 seats. Explained by: differential turnout, thermostatic voting, regression to mean. Fundamentals include this."
"Why combine fundamentals with polls?","Fundamentals: available early, stable, but miss campaign effects. Polls: campaign-responsive, but noisy and arrive late. Combine for best of both. Weight shifts to polls as election approaches."
"What is a generic ballot poll?","'If the election were today, would you vote for the Democratic or Republican candidate?' Not candidate-specific. Predicts national House popular vote. Leads actual results by ~1-2 points D historically."
"How do you translate national popular vote to seats?","Not one-to-one: gerrymandering, geographic sorting. 50% vote ≠ 50% seats. Need seats-votes curve, historically ~1% national swing = ~8 seat change. But varies by cycle."
"What is correlated error in multi-race forecasting?","If polling underestimates Republicans in Ohio, likely also underestimates in Pennsylvania. Errors are correlated by state similarity. Must model this correlation or understate uncertainty."
"How do forecasters model state correlation?","Include national/regional random effects. States in same region share error. Or: model correlation directly based on demographics, past behavior. FiveThirtyEight uses historical correlation matrix."
"What is an ensemble model for elections?","Combine multiple forecast approaches: fundamentals-only, polls-only, polls+fundamentals. Weight by historical accuracy. Guards against model misspecification. Similar to forecast combination in finance."
"What is the 'tipping point' state?","State that would give winner exactly 270 EVs if you sort states by margin. Pennsylvania often tipping point. Forecast should focus on tipping point probability, not just overall win probability."
"What is a swing in election forecasting?","Uniform shift in all states relative to polls/fundamentals. If national environment shifts +2 R, model applies +2 R to every state. Simplistic but captures correlated movement."
"Why do small leads have wide uncertainty?","Close elections mean small swings change outcome. If race is 51-49, 2-point error reverses winner. Far from 50-50, same error doesn't matter. Report probabilities, not just point estimates."
"What is the 538 vs Economist modeling difference?","538: more emphasis on fundamentals early, gradual shift to polls, more conservative uncertainty. Economist: starts with stronger prior, uses more complex modeling. Both Bayesian, different priors."
"How should you report forecast uncertainty?","Win probability (70% chance of winning), margin intervals (expected to win by 2-6 points), scenario analysis (what would change outcome). Avoid false precision. Communicate honestly."
