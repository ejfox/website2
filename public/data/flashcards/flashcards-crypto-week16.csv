"Shor's algorithm breaks what?","RSA, DH, ECC. Polynomial-time factoring and discrete log."
"Grover's algorithm effect on AES?","Halves security. AES-256 → 128-bit security."
"What is harvest-now-decrypt-later?","Adversaries storing encrypted data for future quantum decryption."
"NIST PQC competition winner for KEM?","ML-KEM (Kyber). Lattice-based."
"NIST PQC signature winners?","ML-DSA (Dilithium), SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+)."
"ML-KEM based on what problem?","Module Learning With Errors (MLWE). Lattice problem."
"ML-DSA based on what problem?","Module LWE and Module SIS. Lattice-based."
"SLH-DSA based on what?","Hash functions only. Most conservative choice."
"SLH-DSA signature size?","Large: 7-49 KB depending on parameters."
"ML-KEM key sizes?","Public: 800-1568 bytes. Much larger than ECC."
"What is a hybrid approach?","Combine classical + PQ algorithms. Defense in depth."
"NIST timeline for PQ migration?","Deprecated RSA/ECC by 2030. Disallowed by 2035."
"What is cryptographic agility?","System designed to swap algorithms. Essential for PQ transition."
"FN-DSA (Falcon) based on what?","NTRU lattices. Compact signatures but complex."
"Why lattice problems believed hard?","No known quantum speedup. Studied since 1990s."
"What is code-based cryptography?","Based on decoding random linear codes. Classic McEliece."
