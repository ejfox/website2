"What is a regression line?","The line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (OLS). Best linear predictor of Y given X. Formula: Ŷ = a + bX where a=intercept, b=slope."
"How do you interpret the slope coefficient?","'For each 1-unit increase in X, Y changes by b units on average.' Example: if demand ~ temp has slope 1.2, each degree increase in temp is associated with 1.2 GW higher demand. NOT causation—just association."
"How do you interpret the intercept?","Predicted value of Y when X=0. Often not meaningful if X=0 is impossible (e.g., temperature in Fahrenheit). Mainly anchors the line; slope is usually more interesting."
"What does R² measure in regression?","Fraction of variance in Y explained by the model. R²=0.6 means 60% of variation in demand is explained by temperature. Remaining 40% is unexplained (residual) variation. Same as r² in simple regression."
"What are residuals and why examine them?","Residual = Actual - Predicted (e_i = y_i - ŷ_i). Represent what the model doesn't explain. Plot residuals vs X to check for patterns: if curved → need nonlinear term. If fanning → heteroskedasticity."
"What is the regression fallacy?","Confusing regression to the mean with a real effect. Students who scored highest on test 1 tend to score lower on test 2—not because of some intervention, but because extreme scores regress toward average."
"Why might you add a quadratic term (X²) to regression?","To capture curved relationships. demand ~ temp + temp² can model U-shaped pattern (heating and cooling). The coefficient on temp² tells you direction of curvature: positive = U-shaped, negative = inverted-U."
"What is extrapolation and why is it dangerous?","Predicting Y for X values outside your data range. The linear relationship may not hold beyond observed data. Predicting demand at 120°F when your data only goes to 100°F could be wildly wrong."
"What is RMS error (RMSE)?","Root Mean Square Error = √(average of squared residuals). In same units as Y. Typical prediction error: about 68% of predictions within ±1 RMSE of actual if errors are normal. Lower = better fit."
"What's the difference between fitting and prediction?","Fitting: how well does model explain the data it was trained on? Prediction: how well does it predict NEW data? A model can overfit—explain training data perfectly but predict new data poorly."
"What does 'holding constant' mean in regression interpretation?","In multiple regression, each coefficient shows effect of that variable assuming other variables stay fixed. Rarely literally true, but isolates the partial relationship. 'Effect of temp, holding humidity constant.'"
"How do you find the optimal temperature for minimum demand?","With quadratic model demand = a + b₁*temp + b₂*temp², take derivative and set to zero: optimal = -b₁/(2*b₂). This finds the bottom of the U-curve. Only valid if b₂ > 0."
"What is heteroskedasticity and why does it matter?","Residual variance changes with X (e.g., bigger errors at higher demand levels). Violates OLS assumptions. Doesn't bias coefficients but makes standard errors wrong. Use robust SEs or transform Y."
