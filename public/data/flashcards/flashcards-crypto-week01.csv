"How many keys does a Caesar cipher have?","26. Brute force trivial."
"Why does substitution cipher break?","Frequency analysis. Letter frequencies in ciphertext match plaintext language."
"How does Kasiski examination break Vigenère?","Find repeated sequences in ciphertext. Distance between repeats reveals key length."
"Why did Enigma break?","Mathematical structure + operational failures (no letter encrypts to itself, repeated message keys)."
"What is Kerckhoffs's Principle?","Security depends on key secrecy, not algorithm secrecy."
"What is key space?","Set of all possible keys. Determines brute-force resistance."
"What did every classical cipher have in common that caused it to break?","Preserved some structure from plaintext."
"What is plaintext vs ciphertext?","Plaintext = original message. Ciphertext = encrypted message."
"What is frequency analysis?","Statistical attack using letter frequency patterns. First systematic cryptanalysis."
"When did modern rigorous cryptography begin?","1970s-80s. Shannon's information theory (1949) laid foundation."
