"What is Bayesian inference in one sentence?","Updating beliefs with data: Prior (what you believed before) × Likelihood (how consistent data is with each hypothesis) → Posterior (updated belief). Probability = degree of belief, not just frequency."
"What is Bayes' theorem formula?","P(θ|data) = P(data|θ) × P(θ) / P(data). Posterior ∝ Likelihood × Prior. The denominator normalizes so probabilities sum to 1. In practice, use MCMC to sample from posterior."
"What is a prior distribution?","Your belief about parameter before seeing data. Can be informative (strong prior knowledge) or weakly informative (minimal assumptions). Prior should be justifiable—state your assumptions explicitly."
"What is the likelihood function?","Probability of observing your data given different parameter values. P(data|θ). Tells you which parameter values make the data most plausible. Not a probability distribution over θ."
"What is a posterior distribution?","Updated belief after combining prior and data. P(θ|data). In Bayesian analysis, THIS is the answer. Report posterior mean, median, or credible intervals—not just point estimates."
"What is a credible interval?","Bayesian confidence interval: 95% CI means 95% probability the parameter is in this range (given data and prior). More intuitive than frequentist CI. Directly answers 'where is the parameter?'"
"How does Bayesian updating work on election night?","Prior: pre-election forecast (e.g., 60% Dem wins). Data: county results as they come in. Update: if counties doing better than expected for Dem, posterior probability increases. Continuous updating."
"What is the NYT Needle?","Needle = visual representation of Bayesian updating. Starts at pre-election forecast. Swings as counties report. Uses model predicting county results from demographics + past vote. Shows probability of each candidate winning."
"How do you model county-level votes for election night?","Outcome ~ past_vote + demographics + (random effects). Predict each county's expected result. As results come in, compare actual vs expected. Deviations update state-level estimate."
"What is 'bellwether' thinking in Bayesian terms?","Some counties historically predict state winner. Bayesian: counties with high predictive power for state outcome get more weight in updating. Early-reporting bellwethers can move needle before most votes counted."
"What is conjugate prior and why use it?","Prior and posterior from same distribution family. Simplifies math: closed-form updating. Example: Beta prior + Binomial likelihood → Beta posterior. Useful for simple models, MCMC for complex ones."
"What is MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)?","Algorithm to sample from posterior when closed form unavailable. Creates chain of draws that converge to posterior distribution. Stan, JAGS, PyMC implement this. Enables complex Bayesian models."
"What are Stan, brms, and rstanarm?","Stan: probabilistic programming language for Bayesian models. brms: R package, writes Stan code from formula syntax. rstanarm: R package, pre-compiled Stan models for common cases. All produce MCMC samples."
"How do you check MCMC convergence?","Trace plots: chains should mix well, no trends. R-hat: should be <1.01. Effective sample size: should be >100 per parameter. Divergent transitions: should be zero. Run multiple chains."
"What is posterior predictive checking?","Simulate data from fitted model, compare to actual data. If model is good, simulated data should look like real data. Visual checks: do simulated histograms, scatterplots match? Identify model failures."
