"What methods transfer across Energy, Finance, and Elections?","Regression, time series, Bayesian updating, uncertainty quantification, causal inference, forecast evaluation. Same math, different applications. Learning one domain accelerates learning others."
"How does regression differ across the three domains?","Energy: demand ~ weather (prediction focus). Finance: returns ~ factors (association, not causation). Elections: vote ~ fundamentals + polls (mixed). Same tool, different interpretation."
"How does time series differ across domains?","Energy: strong seasonality, trend, slow-moving. Finance: weak predictability, volatility clustering, fast. Elections: medium-term polling trends, discrete outcomes. Frequency and patterns vary."
"How does Bayesian updating differ across domains?","Energy: update climate projections with new model runs. Finance: update portfolio beliefs with returns. Elections: update probability with new polls or results. Same framework, different priors and data."
"How does event study differ across domains?","Energy: policy implementation (RGGI, RPS). Finance: earnings, regulatory decisions. Elections: debate impact, scandal effect. All measure 'abnormal' deviation from expected path."
"What's different about feedback loops across domains?","Energy: slow (years to know if policy worked). Finance: fast (backtest immediately). Elections: medium (November verdict). Fast feedback = faster learning but more overfitting risk."
"What domain-specific challenges exist in energy analysis?","No randomization, can't A/B test policy. Confounding everywhere. Long time horizons. Slow data updates. Need strong causal reasoning. DiD and quasi-experiments essential."
"What domain-specific challenges exist in finance?","Non-stationarity (regimes change). Data snooping temptation. Transaction costs matter. Competition erodes edges. Randomness dominates. Humility about predictability."
"What domain-specific challenges exist in elections?","Small sample (few elections). Correlated errors across races. Binary outcomes. High stakes, public scrutiny. Rapid environment changes. Probability communication is hard."
"What is a good capstone project structure?","(1) Clear question crossing domains. (2) Identified data sources. (3) Methods justified from course. (4) Explicit assumptions. (5) Honest limitations. (6) Publishable write-up. (7) Reproducible code."
"What capstone questions connect energy and elections?","Do energy prices affect voting? Does election outcome predict clean energy investment? How do energy policies differ by party control? Cross-domain causal questions."
"What capstone questions connect crypto and energy?","Does Bitcoin mining affect local electricity prices? Do energy costs predict miner behavior? Carbon impact of proof-of-work. Requires both on-chain and energy data."
"What capstone questions connect elections and markets?","Election prediction market efficiency. Do election outcomes cause market movements (event study)? Partisan differences in economic policy effects. Politics-finance intersection."
"What is the value of a 'methods transfer guide'?","Personal reference: 'I used DiD in energy; how do I adapt for elections?' Speeds up future work. Documents what you learned. Forces synthesis across domains."
"What mindset should you have finishing this curriculum?","Methods are tools—know when to use which. Uncertainty is real—quantify it honestly. Domains differ but rhyme. Public accountability builds skill. Being wrong teaches more than textbooks."
