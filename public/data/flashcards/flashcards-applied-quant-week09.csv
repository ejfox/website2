"What does GARCH stand for and what does it model?","Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity. Models time-varying volatility: today's volatility depends on yesterday's volatility and yesterday's squared return. Captures volatility clustering."
"What is the GARCH(1,1) equation?","σ²_t = ω + α·ε²_{t-1} + β·σ²_{t-1}. σ²_t = today's variance. ω = baseline. α = weight on yesterday's shock squared. β = weight on yesterday's variance. α + β < 1 for stationarity."
"How do you interpret GARCH(1,1) parameters?","α = reaction to news (how much today's vol responds to yesterday's shock). β = persistence (how much yesterday's vol carries forward). α + β = volatility persistence. Higher β = slower mean reversion."
"What is unconditional vs conditional volatility in GARCH?","Unconditional: long-run average volatility = √(ω / (1 - α - β)). Conditional: today's volatility given past info = √σ²_t. Conditional varies daily; unconditional is the 'home base' vol reverts to."
"What is volatility persistence?","Measured by α + β. If α + β = 0.95, a shock to volatility decays slowly (half-life ~14 days). If α + β = 0.80, shocks decay faster (half-life ~3 days). Crypto often has lower persistence than stocks."
"What is EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) volatility?","σ²_t = λ·σ²_{t-1} + (1-λ)·r²_{t-1}. Special case of GARCH with ω=0 and α+β=1. RiskMetrics uses λ=0.94. Simpler than GARCH but no mean reversion—volatility follows random walk."
"What is the difference between GARCH and EGARCH?","GARCH: symmetric—positive and negative shocks have same effect on volatility. EGARCH: asymmetric—can model leverage effect where negative returns increase volatility more. Better for equity."
"How do you use GARCH for VaR?","(1) Fit GARCH model. (2) Forecast tomorrow's σ. (3) VaR = -z_α × σ, where z_α is quantile from chosen distribution. For 95% VaR with normal, z = 1.65. Use t-distribution for fat tails."
"What is the difference between 1-step and h-step ahead volatility forecasts?","1-step: forecast tomorrow's σ using today's info. h-step: forecast volatility h days ahead. Uncertainty grows with h. For GARCH(1,1): σ²_t+h converges to unconditional variance as h → ∞."
"How do you evaluate volatility forecasts?","Compare predicted σ² to realized variance (e.g., squared returns or realized volatility from high-frequency data). Metrics: MSE, QLIKE. Mincer-Zarnowitz regression: regress realized on forecast, slope should = 1."
"What is realized volatility and why is it better?","RV = sum of squared intraday returns (e.g., 5-minute). More accurate measure of true daily volatility than squared daily return. But requires high-frequency data. Used as benchmark for evaluating GARCH."
"What is the volatility risk premium?","Implied volatility (from options) typically exceeds realized volatility. Investors pay premium for volatility protection. VRP = IV - RV. Positive on average, but varies over time."
"When does GARCH fail?","Structural breaks (crisis changes volatility regime). Jumps (GARCH assumes continuous volatility). Long memory (standard GARCH may understate persistence). Use regime-switching or jump-diffusion models."
"What R packages implement GARCH?","rugarch (most flexible, many GARCH variants). rmgarch (multivariate). fGarch (simpler). Use ugarchspec() to specify model, ugarchfit() to estimate, ugarchforecast() to predict."
