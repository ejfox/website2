"What is perfect secrecy?","Ciphertext provides zero information about plaintext. Pr[E(k,m₀)=c] = Pr[E(k,m₁)=c]."
"What is the One-Time Pad?","c = m ⊕ k. Random key as long as message. Achieves perfect secrecy."
"What proved OTP has perfect secrecy?","Shannon (1949). 'Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems'."
"Shannon's impossibility result?","For perfect secrecy, key must be at least as long as message."
"What is the OTP key reuse attack?","c₁ ⊕ c₂ = m₁ ⊕ m₂. XORing ciphertexts reveals XOR of plaintexts."
"What is information-theoretic security?","Unconditional security. No computational assumptions. Requires key ≥ message."
"What is computational security?","Security against resource-bounded adversaries. Allows short keys. AES, RSA use this."
"What is entropy?","Measure of uncertainty/randomness. Quantifies security margin."
"What was VENONA?","NSA project that broke Soviet one-time pads due to key reuse."
"Why don't we use OTP in practice?","Key distribution problem. Need to securely share key as long as every message."
