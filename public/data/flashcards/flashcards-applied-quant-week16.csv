"Why model at district level instead of national?","National vote doesn't determine who controls House—district wins do. Geographic sorting means 52% national vote might yield 55% seats. Need to predict each district, then aggregate."
"What is PVI (Partisan Voter Index)?","Cook Political Report's measure of district partisan lean. PVI = district's presidential vote vs national average. D+5 means district voted 5 points more Democratic than nation. Baseline for district modeling."
"What predicts district-level outcomes?","Past vote (PVI, prior election), demographics (education, race, urbanization), candidate quality (incumbent, fundraising), spending, national environment. Hierarchical model combines all."
"What is a hierarchical/multilevel model?","Model with multiple levels: district-level predictors + state effects + national effects. Borrows strength across districts. Partially pools information. Key advantage: good predictions even for sparse data."
"What does (1|state) mean in R formula?","Random intercept by state. Each state can shift up/down from national average. Written in lme4/brms syntax. Captures state-level variation not explained by other predictors."
"What is partial pooling?","Compromise between no pooling (separate model per district) and complete pooling (ignore district variation). Hierarchical models shrink extreme estimates toward group mean. Better predictions for sparse data."
"How do you handle uncontested races?","District with no major-party opponent is uncontested. Can't use vote share directly. Options: impute from fundamentals, use presidential vote as proxy, exclude and model separately."
"What is candidate quality and how do you measure it?","Experienced, well-funded, scandal-free candidates do better. Measure: past elected office, fundraising, endorsements. Incumbents have ~5-10 point advantage. Include as predictor."
"What is the incumbency advantage?","Incumbents win more often, even controlling for partisanship. Due to: name recognition, constituent service, fundraising advantage, quality challenger deterrence. Has shrunk recently due to polarization."
"How do you simulate election outcomes from district model?","Draw from posterior predictive distribution for each district. In each simulation: count D wins. Repeat 10,000 times. Get distribution of seat outcomes. Report probability of D majority."
"What is the seats-votes curve?","Relationship between national vote share and seat share. Not linear due to gerrymandering, sorting. Historically ~2% votes = ~50% seats. But curve shape changes with redistricting."
"What are competitive vs safe districts?","Competitive: either party could win (within ~5 points). Safe: one party has large advantage. Focus forecasting effort on competitive races—safe seats rarely flip. About 10-15% of districts competitive."
"How does redistricting affect district modeling?","New district boundaries break historical data. Can't use past district vote. Solutions: re-aggregate past vote to new boundaries, use precinct-level data, or rely more on demographics."
"What data sources exist for district-level analysis?","MIT Election Lab (historical results). Census (demographics). Dave's Redistricting (boundary data). FEC (fundraising). Cook Political Report (ratings). OpenSecrets (money)."
"What is leave-one-out cross-validation for elections?","Train model on all elections except one, predict the held-out election. Repeat for each election. Honest assessment of predictive accuracy. Avoids overfitting to historical patterns."
