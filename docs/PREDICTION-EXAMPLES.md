# üéØ Prediction Examples

Real examples of well-formatted predictions using both CLI and interactive modes.

## üìã Two Types of Predictions

### **Time-bound Predictions** (with deadlines)
Have specific end dates when they should be evaluated.

### **Event-based Predictions** (no deadlines)  
Resolve when the event naturally occurs, regardless of timing.

## Tips for Good Predictions

### ‚úÖ What Makes These Good:
1. **Specific numbers and dates** - No vague terms
2. **Clear resolution criteria** - Exactly how to determine the outcome
3. **Objective data sources** - Third-party verification possible
4. **Appropriate timing** - Use deadlines for time-bound events, omit for natural events
5. **Single, focused outcomes** - Not compound predictions

### ‚ùå Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- "Things will get better" (too vague)
- "AI will be amazing by 2030" (not measurable)
- "Bitcoin will moon and Tesla will crash" (compound prediction)
- "If the world doesn't end, stocks will go up" (conditional)
- "Something big will happen in tech" (no specificity)

### üïê Deadline Guidelines:
- **Use deadlines for**: Market predictions, product launches, time-sensitive events
- **Skip deadlines for**: "Next recession", "First to achieve X", natural event timing
- **Consider carefully**: Will this naturally resolve at a specific time, or when an event occurs?

### üéØ Confidence Calibration:
- **90%+** - You'd bet your house on it
- **70-80%** - Strong conviction, significant research
- **50-60%** - Slight lean, meaningful uncertainty
- **20-30%** - Low probability but possible
- **<10%** - Very unlikely, but trackable

Remember: The goal is to make predictions you can learn from, not just win. Good calibration matters more than being right on any individual prediction!
